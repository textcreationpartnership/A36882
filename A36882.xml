            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He perfect eſſentiall underſtanding of God, being infinite (as God in himſelfe is infinite) and conſequently God (in this ſenſe) being incomprehenſible by the finite act of any created underſtanding, God therefore is comprehenſible by man, by the onely light of the word of his ſeverall ſeventh dayes reſt: as God from the beginning, did manifeſt himſelfe to man, in his ſeverall ſtate and condition, to bee honoured and worſhipped by man, upon the ſeventh day of his law of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. To whoſe worſhip, the eternall bleſſing of the ſeventh dayes reſt, is due by the law to man, in the ſeverall ſtate and condition of man.</p>
            <p>The reaſon is, becauſe in the fulfilling of the commanded worſhip of God, upon the ſeventh day of the Law of righteouſneſſe: the whole law is neceſſarily fulfilled, for the command of the ſeventh day of the Law of righteouſneſſe, is that command which the Lord doth call, the firſt and greateſt Command, to which the leſſer command is like, and neceſſarily implyed, in the great command: For as by the great Command, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth dayes formall worſhip of God, is firſt and immediately commanded (by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate power of the word of the ſeventh dayes reſt) commanding all the actions of man proceeding from his love to God, to worſhip God upon the ſeventh day of his law; which is the ſumme of the firſt table of the law: So by the leſſer command, all the actions of man proceeding from his love are commanded to the image of God (to wit) man.</p>
            <p>Which twofold command is neceſſarily fulfilled in the fulfilling of the commanded formall worſhip of the ſeventh day of the law, as God hath revealed himſelfe to man by the word of his ſeverall ſeventh dayes reſt: For as no man can love God (whom he hath not ſeen) who doth not love his image man, whom he doth ſee. (And in this ſenſe it is ſaid that love is the fulfilling of the law,) So no man can love Gods image man, but he muſt love God whoſe image man is; and therefore it is ſaid, That he that loveth his brother, hath fulfilled the Law.</p>
            <p>As in the great Command therefore of the word of every ſeverall ſeventh dayes reſt of the Law of righteouſneſſe the whole Law is neceſſarily commanded: So in the fulfilling of the great Command of the ſeventh dayes reſt, the whole law is as neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> fulfilled; for if the love of man be defective, either to God or to his image man; mans worſhip is no worſhip. And this is the reaſon, that all the Covenants made by
<pb facs="tcp:49359:3"/> God with man from the beginning, are eſtabliſhed upon the immediate command of the word of every ſeverall ſeventh dayes reſt, as God did manifeſt himſelf to man from the beginning to be worſhipped by man in the ſeverall ſtate and condition of man; for every ſeverall covenant is eſtabliſhed upon the condition of the fulfilling of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the word of the ſeventh dayes reſt of the law of righteouſneſſe, implying the command of the whole law though after a ſeverall formall manner, as God hath ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt himſelfe to man in his ſeverall ſtate and condition, by the word of his ſeverall ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth dayes reſt.</p>
            <p>Now all the covenants made by God with man from the beginning, being but the exercite act, of his moſt ſacred and moſt comfortable eternal decree of Predeſtination: By the underſtanding therefore, of the ſeverall Covenants made by God with man from the beginning; we are led fundamentally, in the knowledge of God; at God did manifeſt himſelfe to man from the beginning.</p>
            <p>The new Covenant therefore (which is the laſt Covenant made by God with man) being eſtabliſhed upon the immediate command of the word of the ſeventh daies reſt, of the Evangelicall law of righteouſneſſe of faith, which is the Lords day: upon which bleſſed day, the Lord by his glorious reſurrection, did reſt from his fulfilling of his promiſe of the bleſſed ſeed.</p>
            <p>The Lords day therefore, is the laſt period of the exercite act, of the ſacred decree of Predeſtination, neceſſarily implying the exercite act of the whole decree, ſo farre therefore as is revealed to man in this life.</p>
            <p>As for the myſtery of the Lords day, after what manner it is the word of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day of the Evangelicall law of righteouſneſſe of faith: it is demonſtrate from the truth of the ſacred word immediately in this Tractate, and ſet downe in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per place: For the Lords day, muſt be the true ſeventh day of the Evangelicall law of righteouſnes of faith: or there is no object for the faith of man, or any law to command man, or any covenant to oblige God to man, or any bleſſing by the Lords infinite merit, by his Evangelicall ſeventh dayes reſt to man: for it is by the immediate power of the bleſſing of his infinite merit, that man and the whole worke of the redemption, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued while there is day in this life.</p>
            <p>By the light therefore of the Lords day (which is the word of the ſeventh daies reſt of the Evangelicall Law of righteouſneſſe of faith) we are led fundamentally, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtratively, from the loweſt effect, of the ſacred decree of predeſtination, to the firſt ſupreme cauſe, neceſſarily implying, the light of all the Covenants, made by God with man from the beginning: Which ſupreme cauſe is God.</p>
            <p>The underſtanding therefore of the Covenants made by God with man from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, is the underſtanding of God, which is called the myſtery of God. In which underſtanding is eternall life, and therfore the Lord ſaith, this is life eternall to know thee to be the only true God: The reaſon is becauſe the word of promiſe, whereby God
<pb facs="tcp:49359:4"/> and man are mutually obliged by Covenant: is the immediate object of faith, without which it is impoſſible either to know or pleaſe God.</p>
            <p>As the fundamentall knowledge of God, doth ariſe from the Covenants made by God with man: So the fundamentall knowledge of the Covenants doth neceſſarily a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe, from the light of the word of eve y ſeverall ſeventh daies reſt, as God hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed himſelfe to man from the beginning, in his ſeverall ſtate and condition. For as hath beene ſaid, upon the immediate command of the word of every ſeverall ſeventh daies reſt the ſeverall Covenants are eſtabliſhed: Firſt and immediatly, obliging man, to the ſeventh daies formall comanded worſhip; and in that commanded worſhip, obliging the obedience of man, to the fulfilling of the command of the whole Law, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the light therefore of the word of the ſeventh daies reſt, we can never attaine to the knowledge of the Covenant.</p>
            <p>The word of God therefore (in this ſenſe implying the Covenant eſtabliſhed upon the word of the ſeventh daies reſt) is the ſubject of this ſmall Tractate. And as God from the beginning did manifeſt himſelfe after a threefold formall manner to man, by the word of his ſeverall ſeventh daies reſt of his Law of righteouſneſſe, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning God did make three ſeverall formall Covenants with man in his ſeverall ſtate and condition: Whereby the Law of God (from the beginning) was formally obliged after a threefold formall ſeverall manner, obliging man in his ſeverall ſtate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition which was likewiſe, after a threefold manner. As for the Covenant made with Abraham (that in his ſeed all the Nations of the earth ſhould be bleſſed) it was the ſame reall Covenant made to Adam after the fall, in the promiſe of the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſeed, though the promiſe was made after a more particuler manner to Abraham after to be declared.</p>
            <p>According to theſe three Covenants: This ſmale Tractate ſhall be devided into three ſeverall bookes containing the fundamentall declaration of the three Covenants made by God with man which are the exercit act, of the ſacred decree of predeſtinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſo farre therefore as is revealed to man in this life.</p>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Ithout the knowledge of the firſt Covenant, (eſtabliſhed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene God and man, upon the immediat command of the word of the firſt ſeventh dayes reſt of the law of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe) there is no reſt for the faith of man, to reſt fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally upon the immediate object of faith: for without the true light of this fundamentall knowledge, the faith of man is unſtable, apt to be carried away, with the light of error, from the true rocke of reſt.</p>
                  <p>For the better informing the judicious Reader, in the true knowledge both of the firſt, and likewiſe of the two laſt Covenants made by God with man: I doe premit this certaine Theologicall ground, ariſing immediatly from the truth of the ſacred word, moſt neceſſarily to be firſt ſet downe.</p>
                  <p>The word of God in the Scripture is taken in a twofold ſence: firſt, the word is taken for the infinite word, infinite power, life, light, righteouſnes; neceſſarily implying the eſſentiall power of the naturall life of the humane nature of the word: man the ſon of God before all time, as he is man the ſon of God, begotten of the ſeed of the woman in time: ſecond perſon of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Trinity.</p>
                  <p>By the word in this ſenſe (before the word was made fleſh of the ſeed of the woman) heaven, earth, the hoaſt of both (to wit man and the creatures) were created in the beginning of time: and in this ſence, the word is incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable to all the creatures created by the word.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the word is taken for the image of the infinite power of the life of righteouſneſſe of the word: neceſſarily implying the image of the power of the naturall life of the humane nature of the word: and in this ſenſe, the word is called the word of the power of righteouſneſſe: and the word in this acception, is communicate to man, and that after a twofold maner.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the word of the power of the life of righteouſnes (neceſſarily imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the power of the naturall life of the word) is eternally written in the heart of man. Secondly, the word of the power of life of righteouſnes (neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:49359:5"/> implying the power of the naturall life of the word) is objected to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall ſenſes of man, and by the ſound of the word written (as it were) in the ſenſe of hearing. This power of the word of righteouſnes, both as it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally written in the heart of man, and as it is objected to his externall ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, is twofold.</p>
                  <p>The firſt power of the word (as it is internally written in the heart of man) is the power of the life of righteouſneſſe, neceſſarily implying the power of the naturall life of the word. By the immediate power of the word (thus writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the heart of man) man is enabled to live the life of righteouſnes, and the naturall life of man: for without the power of naturall life, man can no way live the life of righteouſnes: and in this ſenſe it is ſaid, that in him we live, in him we move, in him we have our being, that is in the word: for by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate power of the word written in the heart of man, (as it is the image of the infinite word, power, life, and being it ſelfe) man doth live, move, and hath his being, in his ſeverall ſtate and condition. Joh. 1.4.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond power of the word of righteouſnes (as the word is internally written in the heart of man) it is the commanding power of the word. For the word of righteouſnes in this ſenſe, is the word of the law of righteouſnes, internally commanding the heart of man (which is the center and originall of all the powers of man, as he is man) commanding man to produce the workes of righteouſnes, according to the law of righteouſnes, as man (by the firſt power of the word written in his heart) is enabled to live the life of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes. For according to that Theologicall Principle; As God doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the action of his creature, ſo before, or in, and with the command, God (in his juſtice) doth inable his creature, with the power of action to fulfill his command. As the word of righteouſnes is objected to the externall ſenſes of man, it is taken in a twofold ſenſe.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the word of the power of life of righteouſnes (neceſſarily implying the power of naturall life of the word) is taken for the word of promiſe, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by God doth covenant with man, to grant the eternall continuation of the life of righteouſnes (neceſſarily implying me naturall life of the word to man) as man is inabled to live that life, by the power of the word written in his heart, which is called the word of eternall life.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, as the word of righteouſnes is objected to the externall ſenſes of man, it is taken for the word of the ſeventh dayes reſt of the law of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     </gap>s, implying the command of the whole law. And the word of the ſeventh dayes reſt of the law, in this ſenſe, hath likewiſe a twofold power.</p>
                  <p>The firſt power of the word of the ſeventh dayes reſt of the law, it is the power of command: for in this ſenſe the word of God is the command of his
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:49359:5"/> law of righteouſnes, commanding the obedience of man, by his workes of righteouſnes, to fulfill the command of his law of righteouſnes, as man is ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to live that life, by the immediate power of the word of the law written in his heart. And in this ſenſe, Gods word is ſaid to be a law to man. For all the commands of God, (righteouſnes it ſelfe) by his word, are the neceſſary commands of his law of righteouſnes: and all the commands of the law of God, are the neceſſary commands of the word of the ſeventh dayes reſt of the law which doeth neceſſarily imply the command of the whole law of God. Gods command therefore to Adam, commanding him to abſtaine from eating of the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge of good and evil, was the neceſſary command of the word of the firſt ſeventh daies reſt of the law of righteouſnes</p>
                  <p>The ſecond power of the word of the ſeventh dayes reſt, is the power of life of righteouſnes, neceſſarily implying the power of the naturall life of the word: and this power of the word of the ſeventh dayes reſt, is by the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate bleſſing of the ſeventh dayes reſt, which is due by the law, to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth dayes worſhip and man: neceſſarily implying, his fulfilling of the whole law, for the ſeventh day is bleſſed for man: and the ſeventh day is ſanctified for Gods worſhip by man; by the immediate power of which bleſſing, of the ſeventh dayes reſt, man doth reſt in the injoying of the word of promiſe.</p>
                  <p>The word of the law therefore written in the heart, and the word of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, and the word of the ſeventh dayes reſt, are really one: for by the word written in the heart, man doth live the life of righteouſnes: and by the word of promiſe, God doth promiſe the eternall continuation of that life: and by the bleſſing of the word of the ſeventh dayes reſt, man doth reſt in the injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his life of righteouſnes: and the word in this threefold ſenſe, is the i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of the righteouſnes of God, the infinite life of righteouſnes.</p>
                  <p>But yet as there is a reall unity, in the word written in the heart, in the word of promiſe, and in the word of the ſeventh dayes reſt: ſo there is a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall difference. For the word of the Law written in the heart, is formally the word of the power of life: and the word of promiſe, is formally the word of eternall life, whereby the eternall continuance of the power of the word in the heart is promiſed: and the word of the ſeventh dayes reſt, is formally the word of eternall reſt, for by the eternall bleſſing of the word of the ſeventh dayes reſt, man doth reſt in the injoying of the word of promiſe, wherby God doth fulfill his promiſe to man, and therefore called truth. And this is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that, as in the word of promiſe, the covenant is eſtabliſhed between God and man, upon the word of the ſeventh dayes reſt; the covenant and the word of the ſeventh dayes reſt, are really one, but of a formall difference.</p>
                  <p>The reall unity of both, is in this, that the word of promiſe (which is the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:49359:6"/> word of eternall life) is by the eternall bleſſing of the word of the ſeventh dayes reſt. And the formall difference of both, is in this, that God and man, (in the word of promiſe) are formally and mutually obliged by covenant, but man is only formally commanded by the word of the ſeventh dayes reſt, of his law of righteouſneſſe. For God in the word of promiſe, doth bind and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liege himſelfe to man by covenant, to grant the eternall continuation of the life of righteouſnes, which man doth injoy, by the power of the word writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in his heart. And becauſe this eternall continuation of the life of man, is by the eternall bleſſing of the word of the ſeventh dayes reſt, therefore God doth mutually bind and obliege man by his covenant, to fulfill the command of his ſeventh dayes worſhip (implying the fulfilling of the whole law) after that formall maner as God hath manifeſted himſelfe, to be worſhipped by man, by the word of his ſeventh dayes reſt: and this obligement of man by covenant, is both upon the promiſe of eternall life, and alſo upon the promiſe of eternall death.</p>
                  <p>By the light of the word therefore of every ſeverall ſeventh dayes reſt; firſt we are led in the knowledge of the ſtate and condition of man, with whom the covenant is made. For the word of the ſeventh dayes reſt, and the word of the law written in the heart, (whereby man doth live) are really one: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, by this light we are led in the knowledge of the covenant, which is alwayes really one, with the word of the ſeventh dayes reſt. For the word of promiſe, is fulfilled by the eternall bleſſing of the word of the ſeventh daies reſt, whereon the condition of the covenant doth depend. Now becauſe, by covenant, man is bound and obliged to the command of the law of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, both upon the promiſe of eternall life, and eternall death, according to the merit of man: The law of GOD, is therefore ſayd, to have a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold reward, (to wit) the bleſſing of eternall reſt to the merit of the obedient, and eternall death to the merit of the diſobedient, which is called the curſe of the law; though eternall death be properly and immediately by the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, for the law of God (in its proper nature) which is the image of his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes, doth command the obedience of man only, upon the eternall bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the ſeventh dayes reſt, and not upon eternall death. And therfore we ſee, that the curſe of the Law, is not ſet downe in the Decalogue.</p>
                  <p>But becauſe as the covenant is eſtabliſhed upon the immediat command of the word of the ſeventh dayes reſt, of the law of righteouſnes, it is the i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage both of the righteouſnes, and juſtice of God, rendring to man according to his merit. For this cauſe the law commands man, both upon the bleſſing of the word of the ſeventh dayes reſt, and upon the curſe of diſobedients; and therefore though by covenant it be left to the freedome of mans election, to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:49359:6"/> live the life of righteouſnes, according to the command of the law of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes, and to merit eternall life, by his obedience; or eternall death by his diſobedience: yet as the covenant is eſtabliſhed upon the immediate com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the words of the ſeventh dayes reſt of the law of righteouſnes, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience of man is both obliged and commanded, upon the eternall bleſſing of the ſeventh dayes reſt, and upon the inevitable curſe of eternall death.</p>
                  <p>By the light of this Theologicall infallible ground, (ariſing from the light of the truth of the ſacred word) the judicious Reader is led in the knowledge of the three covenants made by God with man; which are linckt together, as it were, in a chaine, as may appeare by the ſubſequent declaration of this tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctat. Firſt therefore of the firſt covenant made by God with man.</p>

                  <p>BEcauſe the firſt covenant doeth neceſſarily preſuppoſe the firſt eſtate of man, with whom the firſt covenant was made: This firſt Booke therefore ſhalbe divided into theſe two parts: The firſt ſhall contain the declaration of the firſt eſtate of man. The ſecond ſhall contain the declaration of the firſt covenant.</p>
                  <p>The firſt ſtate of man, was the created ſtate of man, the laſt created of all creatures; whoſe creation doth preſuppoſe the whole workes of the creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which is the very firſt period of the exercit act, of the ſacred decree of predeſtination; exercit by the infinit eſſentiall word immediately.</p>
                  <p>As for the knowledge of the firſt eſtate of man, it muſt neceſſarily ariſe from the light of the word of the firſt ſeventh dayes reſt. For the word of the firſt ſeventh dayes reſt of the law of righteouſneſſe, and the word of the law firſt written in the heart of man, are of one reall life and light. For as the word of the firſt ſeventh dayes reſt of the law of righteouſnes, was the word of the eternall reſt of righteouſnes, (by the eternall bleſſing of the firſt ſeventh dayes reſt) ſo the word of the law of righteouſnes, firſt written in the heart of man, was the word of the power of the life of righteouſnes, neceſſarily implying the power of the naturall life of the word. For by the immediate power of the word thus written in the heart of man, man was inabled to live the life of righteouſnes, &amp; to live the naturall life of man in his firſt ſtate &amp; condition.</p>
                  <p>But as man of all creatures, was laſt created, ſo man was the ornament, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and (as it were) the maſter piece of the workes of the creation. For of all the creatures created by God, the creation of man was the moſt rare
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:49359:7"/> and curious worke. And though it be ſayd, That man was made a little lower then the Angels (to wit, in the perfection of glory:) yet the perfection of mans creation was ſuperiour to the creation of Angels: for all creatures were either intellectuall or corporall. But that two ſo ſtrange differing natures, ſhould be eſſentially united in the nature of man, it is the wonder of nature it ſelfe. All the creatures therefore being perfectly created, man (the ornament of the workes of the creation) was created in the ſtate of humane perfection. This created perfection of man, was the perfect life of righteouſnes, neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily implying the perfection of the naturall life of man.</p>
                  <p>This perfection of man did ariſe from the perfection of the word of the law firſt written in the heart of man: for in and with the immediat act of the creation of man, as the word of the law of righteouſnes, was ſpiritually and immediatly written in the ſoule, eſſentially united to the heart, ſo by the ſame immediate act of the ſpirituall writer, the word of the law (as the law is ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall) was actually and ſpiritually enlightned, by the ſpirituall light of his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpirit in the ſoule of man. By the power of which ſanctifying light, the heart of man (to which the ſoule is eſſentially united (was by the ſame imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate act) ſanctified with the ſpirituall action of holines. By the immediate ſanctifying power of the word, thus actually and ſpiritually enlightned, man was enabled to live the perfect life of righteouſnes and holines; wherby man was a perfect naturall and ſpirituall man, and the perfect image of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and holines. And this was the firſt ſtate and condition of man, with whom the firſt covenant was made by God.</p>
                  <p>Man therefore (by the perfection of his creation) was of a twofold perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. The firſt was the naturall perfection of man: the ſecond was his ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall perfection. Of this twofold perfection of man, briefly, ſo far as concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the ſubject in hand. And firſt, of the naturall perfection of man, and next of his ſpirituall perfection.</p>
                  <p>The naturall perfection of man, doth conſiſt in the eſſentiall union of the intellectuall and ſenſitive nature of man. Firſt therefore of the created perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the intellectuall nature of man, abſtractly: and next of the created per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the ſenſitive nature of man, and of the eſſentiall union of the two natures. The created perfection of the intellectuall nature of man, is in the perfection of the ſoule of man: and the perfection of the ſoule, is from the perfection of the naturall power of the life of the word: which the perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſpirituall life of the word, doeth neceſſarily imply. For the word is ſpiritually and immediately written in the ſoule of man, as it is the image of the infinite word, infinite power, perfection, life, light, righteouſnes, truth, and eternity it ſelfe. By the immediate naturall power of the word, thus im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:49359:7"/> written in the ſoule of man, the ſoule doth live, move, intellectually; and hath its perfect eternall ſtate of intellectuall being, as the word (immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately written in the ſoule) is perfect and eternall, the ſoule of man therefore was created as perfect a true eternall ſpirit in the humane ſphere, as the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall ſpirit in the Angelicall ſphere: for both as they are created ſpirits (of a ſimple immateriall ſubſtance) doe live, move, intellectually, and have their eternall ſtate of intellectuall being, by the ſame reall power of the word, ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually written in the intellectuall ſpirit of both, though after a differing man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. And though the intellectuall ſoule of man, while it is in the eſſentiall u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with the ſenſitive nature, doth act by the mediate, organicall ſenſitive po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers, yet the ſoule (in its intellectuall operations) doth advance it ſelfe above all ſenſitive power, and doth exerciſe its intellectuall operation, without the help of any ſenſitive organ. And therfore Ariſtotle (that true light of all Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophicall truth) doth peremptorily affirme, that it is not to be fained or ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, that the ſoule of man (in its intellectuall operations) doth uſe the help of any ſenſitive organ, but that is meerely independent from any ſenſitive or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan. And conſequently, I doe neceſſarily conclude, that the ſoule of man is likewiſe independent from any ſenſitive organ in its being. For according to that Philoſophicall principle; The maner of the creatures action, doth ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily follow the creatures being. The intellectuall ſoule of man there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, being independent from all ſenſitive organ, both in being, and in intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectuall operation, the ſoule of man is ſeparable from all ſenſitive power, and conſequently immortall. And though, while the ſoule is in the eſſentiall uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of both the natures, the underſtanding faculty of the ſoule doth depend objectively upon the ſenſe of phanſie, yet the dependence is but an accidence and not eſſentiall. And though Ariſtotle doth affirme (and that moſt truly) that in the act of underſtanding, the <hi>ſpecies</hi> of the eternall object being recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the underſtanding, doth become one with the underſtanding, (for in this union doth conſiſt the underſtanding of the received <hi>ſpecies</hi>) yet this uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is likewiſe accidentall and ſeparable; for otherwiſe the underſtanding ſhould ſtand alwayes affected, which is repugnant to all Philoſophicall truth.</p>
                  <p>Heere by the way, the judicious Reader may obſerve the prerogative of the ſoule of man, above all ſublunary formes, informing the materiall compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit. For as all other ſublunary formes doe ariſe from the materiality of the compoſit, ſo they doe ſtand and fall with the compoſit; but though the intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectuall ſoule of man (which is the firſt act of man, as he is man) doth eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally informe the ſenſitive materiall nature of man: yet the intellectuall ſoule being every way independent in being, from the ſenſitive body, and no waies ariſing from the materiality thereof, is ſeparable from the ſenſitive body, and conſequently immortall.</p>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:49359:8"/>
                  <p>Becauſe the immortality of the ſoule, is a moſt concerning fundamentall point of faith, and a maine fundamentall point of this tractat, for the Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers more full ſatisfaction, I referre the truth of the point from the truth of the ſacred Word.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the intellectuall ſoule of man, (humane ſpirit) is begotten by the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall father of ſpirits: as the father therefore is eternity it ſelf (to ſpeak with the Schoolmen) both from the part before, and from the part after, that is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all beginning or ending, excluding all quantitative termes of time; ſo hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane ſpirit begotten of the eternall father, is eternall from the part after. For though the ſoule of man hath its beginning from the eternall father, yet the ſoule of man (humane ſpirit) is without all ending with the father. This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten humane ſpirit by the eternall father, (ſince the creation) is by the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall fathers immediate concurring with the ſenſitive body, while as the ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive body commeth to ſuch ſenſitive perfection in the wombe, as the high e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laborate vitall ſpirits of the heart, doe appetite the intellectuall information of the ſoule. For in that point of time, the eternall father (as he hath obliged himſelfe by covenant) doth concurre, and by the immediate power of the word doth unite the intellectuall nature and ſpirit of man, elaborate to the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall ſpirits of the heart: from whence the life of man, as he is man, is diffuſed o all the parts and powers of the ſenſitive body. By this intellectuall infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, the infant in the wombe, is man, and in the prefixed time of birth, brought forth man in the world, by man female, the woman.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the intellectuall ſoule of man (humane ſpirt) is of the ſame ſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riphicall ſphere, with the humane ſpirit of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, begotten of the ſame eternall Father. The ſoule of man therefore (humane ſpirit) is eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall and immortall.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the Lord himſelfe doth affirme, Luke 12.4. That the ſoule of man (humane ſpirit) cannot be killed: and conſequently the ſoule of man is eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall and immortall.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, God is not the God of the dead, but of the living. Mark. 12.27. The ſoule of the very reprobate therefore, though eternally tortured in hell, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver dying, yet the ſoule muſt live in that eternall dying.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, the ſoule of man, by the commanding power of the eternall word (ſpiritually and immediately written in the ſoule) is eternally bound and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to the command of the Law of God, which is eternall: the ſoule of man therefore, and the law of God, are neceſſarily coeviternall one with another.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, the twofold reward of the law is eternall, as the law of God is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall, which is due by the law to man, according to the merit of man. The ſoule of man therefore, by the immediate power of the word of the law writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten

So there is no intermiſſion of time for the actuall ſuffering, of the curſed hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors and tortors of the ſtate of the reprobate, howſoever the reprobate departs this life, for heaven and Earth muſt periſh, before one jot or tittle of time of the law doe periſh. And this is the eſtate of the faithfull and of the repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, howſoever they depart this life, till the great day, when the ſoule being reunited to the ſenſitive body, as the ſoule and body of the faithfull, is actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly glorified by the enjoying of the reward of the law in the full extent, by an incorruptible crowne, of glory: So the ſoule and body of the reprobate, are caſt downe to the eternall unquenchable fire of the eternall lake.</p>
                  <p>If the moſt wicked, were truly inſtructed, in the immortality of the ſoul, and in the neceſſity of the ſuſtaining, of the fearfull tortors of the ſoul, ſo ſoon as they depart this life; they would not make ſuch haſt to haſten their tortors, by laying violent hands on themſelves, and to be ſo eaſily led with the Devills temptations; for this miſery comes chiefly by ignorance, whereof the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill takes ſuch occaſion, to lead wretched man ſo long by his damnable dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, till by continuance in ſin and wickedneſſe, God give him over to a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate minde. And now to returne to the point in hand.</p>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:49359:9"/>
                  <p>As by the naturall power of the life of the word immediatly written in the ſoule, the ſoule doth live in its intellectuall being; So in that life, is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectuall light of the ſoule, whereby the underſtanding is only produced in act in the intellectuall operations of the ſoule, for without this light, all the created light of God, cannot produce the underſtanding and will, in act, in the intellectuall operations of the ſoule. And therefore <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> doth affirm, that it is as impoſſible, for the underſtanding to be produced intellectually in act, without this pure light; as for the ſenſe of ſeeing, to be produced ſenſitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in act without the light of the Sun, or ſome materiall light. And from this intellectuall light of the ſoul of man, man is ſaid to be an intellectuall creature. And this is that very reall light, which <hi>Ariſtole</hi> did aſcribe to his intellect agent; for though <hi>Ariſt.</hi> was ignorant of the writing of the word, either in the ſoul or in the heart of man; yet <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> did truly apprehend both the intellectuall light of the word in the ſoule, and the rationall light of the word literally written in the heart of man.

                  <p>But <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> did never affirme, that the intellect agent (contrary to all Philoſophicall truth) doth enlighten the <hi>ſpecies</hi> of the externall ſenſitive ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, received in the ſenſe of phanſie, which miſerable aſſertion of ſome igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant pretended moderne naturall Philoſophers, did beget that damnable opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the mortallity of the ſoule.</p>

                     </gap>fection of the ſenſitive nature of man: And of the eſſentiall union of the intellectuall and ſenſitive nature.</head>
                  <p>THe declaration of the created perfection of the ſenſitive nature of man, is a point of no ſmall difficulty; becauſe the ſenſitive nature of man, is mixed with the intellectuall nature, as man is man intellectuall and ſenſitive; which created perfection, of the ſenſitive nature of man, doth ſurmount the perfection of all the ſenſitive creatures created by God: for firſt, though ſome ſenſitive creatures doe exceed the ſenſitive nature of man in the degree of ſome particular ſenſe; as the Eagle or Falcon, in the ſenſe of ſeeing, the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel or Hound, in the ſenſe of ſmelling: yet in the compleat perfection of all the internall and externall ſenſes; no ſenſitive creature doth come neare the perfection of the ſenſitive nature of man.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, all other ſenſitive creatures (beſide man) by the act of the ſenſes, are ſaid properly to ſent the externall ſenſitive object: but man by the act of his ſenſes is properly ſaid to know the externall ſenſitive object; of which
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:49359:9"/> ſenſitive knowledge, all other ſenſitive creatures are incapable.</p>
                  <p>The declaration therefore, of the ſenſitive perfection of man, is both Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logicall and Philoſophicall; for though the power of life and light of the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive nature of man (according to the truth of naturall Philoſophy) do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed immediatly from the braine; yet that life and light, doth proceed origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally from the heart, and from the naturall power of the word literally writen in the heart of man, as hee is man intellectuall and ſenſitive, the declaration whereof is proper to the Theolog.</p>
                  <p>But becauſe we cannot attaine to the knowledge of perfection of the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive nature of man (being a mixt nature of the intellectuall and ſenſitive na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) without the knowledge of the eſſentiall union of the intellectuall and ſenſitive nature of man, which is by the power of the word written in the heart of man: briefly therefore of this eſſentiall union.</p>
                  <p>As the eternall Father of ſpirits (by the immediate power of the word) doth unite the intellectuall ſoul humane ſpirit, to the vitall ſpirits of the heart; ſo the twofold power of the life of the word, is written and as it were imprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the heart of man, which is the fountain and originall of the life of man.</p>
                  <p>The firſt power of life, is the naturall life of the word written in the heart of man, as it is the image of the eternall life of the infinite word. And this power of naturall life, is diffuſed from the heart, to all the powers of man, as he is man intellectuall and ſenſitive.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond power of the life of the word (written in the heart of man) is the power of the life of righteouſneſſe: and this power of life is diffuſed from the heart to all the powers of man proceeding from the will of man, as he is man intellectuall and ſenſitive; whereby the naturall man is inabled with the power of the life of righteouſneſſe to live according to the literall command of the law; that is, according to the letter of the law of the word of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth dayes reſt, implying the command of the whole law of righteouſneſſe. And as from the power of the word thus written in the heart: man is inabled with the twofold power of life: ſo by this twofold power of life, man is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled with a twofold power of light, the firſt is the naturall light of man, the ſecond is the light of righteouſneſſe. And therefore it is ſaid, <hi>That in it was life, and that life was the light of man in it,</hi> Joh. 1.4. that is in the word, as it is the power of the image of the infinit word (life and light) written in the heart of man: Firſt therefore of the naturall life and light of man, as he is a naturall man, intellectuall and ſenſitive by the naturall power of the word written in his heart: And next of his life and light of righteouſneſſe.</p>
                  <p>This naturall light proceeding from the naturall life of man, is called the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall light of man: And from this rationall light (which is a mixed light)
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:49359:10"/> man is ſaid to be a rationall creature. As from the pure intellectuall light of the ſoule, man is ſaid to be an intellectuall creature.</p>
                  <p>By this rationall light (proceeding from the naturall life of man, as hee is man intellectuall and ſenſitive) as the naturall underſtanding of man, is ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally produced in act to underſtand the <hi>ſpecies</hi> of the externall ſenſitive object received in the underſtanding: ſo his ſenſitive powers are produced in act, to know the externall ſenſitive object rationally. And the externall light where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the externall ſenſitive object is actually enlightned to bee apprehended by the act of the ſenſes of man, is the naturall light of the creatures, created for man, as the light of the Sunne, Moon, Stars, the light of fire, and ſuch like; whereby the ſenſe of ſeeing is produced rationally in act. So is found to the ſenſe of hearing, reliſh to the taſte, odour to the ſmelling and taction (if I may uſe the terme) to the tactive ſenſe, all ariſing from the ſeverall nature of the creature, and proportionate to the ſeverall externall ſenſe of man; which naturall light of the creatures is really one with the naturall light of the words in the heart of man, though of a formall difference; the one formally naturall, the other formally rationall. And as the creatures were created for man; ſo man and the creatures were continued in the ſtate of their created perfection, by the immediat bleſſing of God by his word of the firſt ſeventh dayes reſt of the law of righteouſneſſe, while man did ſtand in the perfection of his obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the commands of God; for it is by the only immediate bleſſing of the word of the ſeventh dayes reſt, that God doth give the influence of his bleſſing to the naturall life and light of man, and to the creatures created for man, and to the ſpirituall life and light of man.</p>
                  <p>By this rationall light, the underſtanding of man (as he is man intellectuall and ſenſitive) is rationally produced in act, by the three operations of the act of the underſtanding according to <hi>Ariſtotle;</hi> the firſt whereof is the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of the ſimple tearmes of the <hi>ſpecies,</hi> of the externall ſenſitive object re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in the underſtanding, as the received <hi>ſpecies</hi> doth repreſent the truth of the ſenſitive externall object. The ſecond, is the compounding of things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeperable, apprehended in the received <hi>ſpecies,</hi> and the dividing of things ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable. The third is in diſcurring (and as it were) running from the things apprehended and knowne in the received <hi>ſpecies,</hi> to conclude things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne. And from this laſt operation of the underſtanding, the rationall act of the underſtanding is called diſcurſive. And the concluſion inferred by this diſcurſive act; is only probable; and hence doth ariſe the formall diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the act of the underſtanding of man (as he is man intellectuall and ſenſitive) and of the act of the underſtanding of man, as he is intellectuall: for the rationall diſcurſive act of the underſtanding, is formally probable;
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:49359:10"/> inferring only a probable concluſion, called Opinion. But the intellectuall act of the underſtanding, is formally neceſſary definitive and ſcientificall, equall with the perfect demonſtration called Science.</p>
                  <p>But the rationall light, whereby the rationall and intellectuall act of the underſtanding is produced in act, is one reall act light, though the one (to wit, the intellectuall light) bee a pure unmixed light, which is the naturall light of the word, as is immediately written in the ſoule, and the other a mixed light, proportionate to the rationall act of the underſtanding, and ſenſes of man. To make this appear by a familiar example of the Sun.</p>
                  <p>As the Sun is placed in the midſt of the planets, the three ſuperiour planets are inlightened by the pure light of the Sun, whereby they give downe the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of their ſeverall natures to the ſublunary creatures. And as the Sunne doth paſſe through the orbs of the three inferiour planets through the region of the fire, and the three regions of the aire; the light and heat of the Sun is mixed, qualified and proportionate to the temper of the ſeverall natures of the ſublunary creatures.</p>
                  <p>As this twofold light therefore of the Sun, is really one; ſo is the light of the word, written in the ſoule and heart of man (which is the image of the naturall life and light of the Son of righteoſneſſe) really one.</p>
                  <p>Next of the light of man proceeding from his life of righteouſneſſe.</p>
                  <p>By the literall light of the word in the heart of man (which is the light of the letter of the Law) the underſtanding of man (as hee is man intellectuall and ſenſitive) is l terally produced in act, according to the letter of the Law of righteouſneſſe, implyed in the command of the word of the ſeventh dayes reſt of the Law of God: for the literall light and command of the word of the ſeventh dayes reſt, and the literall light and command of the word of the Law of righteouſneſſe, written in the heart of man is one reall light and command. And this light of the word written in the heart of man (as it is the ligh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> of the word, as the word is a Law to man) is (as it were) a great lumpe of light, ſet upon a table in the heart; enlightning all the <hi>ſpecies</hi> of the externall ſenſitive objects as they are received in the underſtanding.</p>
                  <p>By this great light, firſt man is inabled by the act of his underſtanding (as he is man intellectuall and ſenſitive) to diſcerne and to judge, the <hi>ſpecies</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in the underſtanding, by the act of his mediate ſenſes, whether the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive object be apprehended by the ſenſes, inlightened by the light of the Law; or whether it be apprehended by the act of the ſenſes, inlightned by the falſe adultrous light of Satan, whereby Satan doth continually betray man to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe the Law of God.</p>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:49359:11"/>
                  <p>Secondly, by this great light (as it is the light of the word commanding man, really one with the light and command of the word of the ſeventh dayes reſt of the law of righteouſneſſe) man is inlightened to underſtand, that he is commanded to reject the <hi>ſpecies</hi> of the ſenſitive object, inlightened by the falſe adulterous light of Satan (which is alwayes contrary to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Law) and to apprehend the <hi>ſpecies</hi> inlightened by the light of the Law, at his pleaſure. And this is that great light which is called the light and Law of conſcience.</p>
                  <p>As by the power of this great literall light in the heart of man (really one with the literall light of the word of the ſeventh dayes reſt of the Law) the underſtanding of man (as he is man intellectuall and ſenſitive) is literally and morally produced in act; So by the power of this light, his ſenſes are literally &amp; cognoſcitively produced in act to know the externall ſenſitive object by the literal ſenſitive light of the word of the ſeventh dayes reſt of the Law of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe; for the literall light of the Law (which is by the ſound of the word) doth neceſſarily begin at the externall ſenſes. And therefore (ſince the fall and redemption of man) faith, which is morall faith, is ſaid to bee the hearing of the word.</p>
                  <p>But becauſe it is in the freedome of mans election by the act of his ſenſes (proceeding from the free act of his will) to apprehend the externall ſenſitive object inlightened by what light ſoever; therefore God by his Covenant doth only binde and oblige man to live this life of righteouſneſſe according to the literall light of the word of the ſeventh dayes reſt of the Law of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe. As man is enabled to live the life of righteouſneſſe by the immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate power of the word written in his heart: But God by his Covenant doth not formally command man to live the life of righteouſneſſe, but leaveth it to the freedome of mans election by his obedience to the command of the word of the ſeventh dayes reſt of the Law either to chooſe eternall life by his obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, or eternall death by his diſobedience.</p>
                  <p>The reaſon is, becauſe the life of righteouſneſſe doth immediately proceed from the act of the will, which is the act of the ſoule of man, which cannot bee neceſſitate by any command whatſoever, for the will of the ſoule is created with the perfection of ſuch contradictory and ſpecificall freedome, as all the created powers of God are not able to nec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ſſitate or enforce the free act of the will by any meanes under the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens though the act of the will as it is intellectuall and ſenſitive may be exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally coacted) for as the will cannot be killed; ſo the will can neither bee ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitate by any command. But as the Covenant is eſtabliſhed upon the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:49359:11"/> immediate command of the word of the ſeventh dayes reſt of the Law of righteouſneſſe; the workes of righteouſneſſe according to the Law, are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded both upon the eternall bleſſing of the ſeventh dayes reſt, and upon the curſe of eternall death, the firſt and immediate command whereof, (as the ſeventh day is the great command of the Law) is the ſeventh dayes comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded worſhip; implying the command of the whole Law, which doth both ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige and command man to worſhip God in the truth of his promiſe; for by the eternall bleſſing of the ſeventh dayes reſt, the word of promiſe is alwayes fulfilled according to the obedience of man; or by the inflicting of the curſe of eternall death upon the diſobedience of man, to the command of his word, his promiſe is likewiſe fulfilled: for it is all one for God not to fulfill his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe by his Covenant, as to be no God. And this is the firſt reaſon of Gods eſſentiall attribute of truth, and that his word (which is his immediate image) is called truth.</p>
                  <p>The literall command of the Law ariſing from the letter of the Law, is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led (by the Theologs) the morall command of the Law; and therefore the word of the ſeventh dayes reſt, (implying the command of the whole Law of righteouſneſſe) is called the morall Law of God, obliging and commanding (as it were) the manners of man to God and to his image man; as the voluntary action of man doth concerne God, or his image man; and from this morall denomination of the Law, the voluntary action of man, whether by his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, or diſobedience to the command of the Law, is ſaid to bee formally morall, for both are equally the exercite act of the Law, and to both the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of the Law is equally due by the Law, according to the merit of mans obedience, or diſobedience to the command of the Law: from this morall denomination likewiſe of the Law, the literall light of the Law is called the morall light of the Law; for a formall difference between the literall and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall light of the Law (ariſing immediatly from the letter of the Law) and the ſpirituall light of the Law, which is the immediate light of the holy Spirit. And from this morall denomination of the litterall light of the Law (ſince the fall, and redemption of man) faith (ariſing from the morall light of the Law) is called morall faith, for a formall difference of morall faith from ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall faith which doth ariſe from the immediate ſpirituall light of the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, in the immediate act of regeneration.</p>

And in that commanded ſpirituall worſhip, commanding <hi>Adams</hi> ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall obedience (by his ſpirituall works of holineſſe) to fulfill the command of the Law of righteouſneſſe, according to the ſpirituall light and command of the word of the firſt ſeventh dayes reſt, to whoſe perfect worſhip and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, the eternall bleſſing of the word of the firſt ſeventh dayes reſt, was due by the Law of God.</p>
                  <p>By this light of the word of the firſt ſeventh dayes reſt of God, from the workes of the creation: <hi>Adam</hi> (by the perfect act of his ſpirituall under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding)
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:49359:12"/> did perfectly apprehend God, to bee the Creator of Heaven, of earth, of man, of the creatures, and that by the immediate eternall bleſſing of the firſt ſeventh dayes reſt of God; the world, man, and the creatures, were continued and preſerved in the perfection of their created eſtate: And upon the immediate command of the word of the firſt ſeventh dayes reſt (imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the command of the whole law of righteouſneſſe) the firſt Covenant was made with man, afterward to be declared.</p>
                  <p>As <hi>Adam</hi> by the ſpirituall light of his underſtanding (really one with the ſpirituall light of the word of the ſeventh dayes reſt) did perfectly underſtand God; as God revealed himſelfe to Adam by the word of his firſt ſeventh dayes reſt, (wherein the perfection of Adams underſtanding of God did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt,) ſo Adam by the created perfection of his ſpirituall action of holineſſe, did adequate the perfection of the command of the Law, as Adam was firſt obliged to the Law of God; for if Adams ſpitituall action of holineſſe, had not been of equall power with the perfection of the command of the Law, (which is in the ſpirituall command) and the firſt Covenant, being eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed upon the immediate command of the word of the firſt ſeven dayes reſt of the Law, both upon the eternall bleſſing of the firſt ſeven dayes reſt, and upon the curſe of eternall death, Adam could never have fulfilled the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the command of the Law, but muſt have neceſſarily fallen under the curſe of eternall death, which had been moſt high injuſtice in God, in bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and obliging (his intellectuall creature) man, to a law (upon the curſe of eternall death) above the power of his obedience, by his ſpirituall action of holineſſe, for it was only by Adams ſpirituall action of holineſſe, that the law was to be fulfilled; for though Adam was created with the power of morall action, yet while Adam ſtood in his ſtate of perfection, Adams morall action was not actuall; neither could his ſpirituall action of holineſſe be called for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally and properly morall; which denomination is extended both to the obedience and tranſgreſſion of the Law, as hath been formerly declared: Adams morall action therefore was not actuall, till the Law of righteouſneſſe was tranſgreſſed by Adam; and then Adams morall action was actuall, and formally morall, and morally evill, and the greateſt evill that ever was or can be committed by man.</p>
                  <p>Now as Adam (by the perfection of his ſpirituall underſtanding of the word of the firſt ſeventh dayes reſt of the Law of righteouſneſſe) did perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly underſtand God, as God revealed himſelfe to be honoured and worſhipped by his reſt from the works of the Creation: So Adam by the perfection of his naturall underſtanding muſt needs apprehend the being, power, perfection, goodneſſe, life, light, knowledge, underſtanding, wiſdome in himſelfe and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:49359:13"/> the creatures, to flow from the infinite perfection of the Creator, whereby Adam was led in the underſtanding of the eſſentiall Attributes of God, which eſſentiall underſtanding of God in Adam muſt be imperfect, God as he is eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall being infinite and incomprehenſible; Adams perfect underſtanding of God therefore was perfected by the perfection of his ſpirituall underſtanding of the word of the firſt ſeventh dayes reſt, as God did manifeſt himſelfe to man, to be underſtood and worſhipped by man, for God can no otherwiſe be comprehended by the act of the underſtanding of man or Angel, but after that formall manner that God doth minifeſt himſelfe, to be underſtood and worſhipped by either.</p>
                  <p>And ſo much briefly of the created, naturall and ſpirituall perfection of man, with whom the firſt Covenant was made by God, which is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of the firſt part of the firſt Book.</p>

                  <head type="sub">Of a threefold compariſon between the created, naturall, and ſpirituall perfection of the firſt Adam, with the naturall and ſpirituall perfection of the ſecond Adam.</head>
                  <p>IT is ſaid, That the firſt Adam was made a living ſoule, a naturall man, and from the earth earthly, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.45, 46, 47.</p>
                  <p>Adam therefore was not created in the ſtate of naturall and ſpirituall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, neither could he be created the image of righteouſneſſe and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, or a true ſpirituall man. I anſwer briefly to the Objection.</p>
                  <p>The Apoſtle (in theſe three verſes of this chapter) doth make a threefold compariſon between the firſt and ſecond Adam.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is in the 45. verſe, the ſenſe whereof is this, The firſt Adam was made a living ſoule (to wit, to live the perfect life of righteouſneſſe, neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily implying the perfection of his naturall life,) but the ſecond Adam was not only made a living ſoule, but likewiſe a quickning ſpirit, where the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the naturall and ſpirituall life of the firſt Adam is compared with the power of the naturall and ſpirituall life of the ſecond Adam.</p>
                  <p>The firſt Adam by the power of his naturall and ſpirituall life, was not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to quicken himſelfe, or any man elſe, being dead; but the ſecond Adam by the power of his naturall life, in ſuſtaining the curſed death of the Croſſe, did redeem the firſt Adam, and all men condemned and dead under the curſe of the Law by eternall death in Adam their head; for the tranſgreſſion of the Law by Adam, and by the infinite power of his Reſurrection from the dead,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:49359:13"/> did raiſe up Adam, and all men condemned and dead in Adam their head, quickning and reconciling all men (by the price of his blood) to the love and favour of God for that firſt ſinne.</p>
                  <p>The firſt Adam therefore (notwithſtanding of his naturall and ſpirituall perfection) in reſpect of the ſecond Adam, may be truly ſaid to be but a living ſoule, and not a quickning ſpirit.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond compariſon is in the 46. verſe, where the ſpirituall perfection of the firſt Adam is compared with the ſpirituall perfection of the ſecond A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam; the ſenſe of the words is this.</p>
                  <p>Though the firſt Adam was created in ſuch ſpirituall perfection, yet his ſpirituall perfection was not eſſentiall, but habituall and conditionall: But the ſpirituall perfection of the ſecond Adam (the Lord Jeſus Chriſt) is Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall; and therefore the firſt Adams ſpirituall perfection in reſpect of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Adams eſſentiall perfection, was but the perfection of a naturall man, as the ſpirituall perfection of the ſecond Adam was the eſſentiall perfection of an eſſentiall ſpirituall man, the eternall Sonne of God, begot of the ſeed of the woman in time.</p>
                  <p>The third compariſon is in the 47. verſe, where the humane ſenſitive na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the firſt Adam is compared with the humane ſenſitive nature of the ſecond Adam: The ſenſe of the words is this.</p>
                  <p>The firſt Adam as he is man ſenſitively, was created of earthly principles immediately, and therefore from the earth earthly; But the ſecond Adam as he is man ſenſitively (Chriſt Jeſus the naturall Son of God) was begot of the ſanctified ſeed of the woman immediately, and every way from the heaven heavenly, in reſpect of whoſe humane ſenſitive nature, the humane ſenſitive nature of the firſt Adam, may be ſaid to be from the earth earthly; for though the firſt Adam was created in the ſtate of ſuch naturall and ſpirit perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet he muſt have lived eternally upon earth, by covenant.</p>
                  <p>Here by the way, whereas the Apoſtle ſaith, that the firſt man was from the earth earthly; the words muſt not be taken in the literall, but in the ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ſenſe, which is this: The firſt man was from the earth, to wit, as he is ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive, for otherwiſe we conclude the living immortall ſoule of man to be from the earth, in which ſenſe the wicked wreſts this place to their eternall damnation.</p>
                  <p>The Apoſtle therefore (in this part of the chapter) doth not ſpeake ſimply of the created naturall and ſpirituall perfection of the firſt Adam, but compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratively with the eſſentiall, naturall, and ſpirituall perfection of the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, ſecond perſon of the glorious Trinity; for otherwiſe the firſt A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam is affirmed by the Apoſtle himſelfe, to be created after the image of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:49359:14"/> and holineſſe, which is the image of God infinite, righteouſneſſe and holineſſe, for the created perfection of man was ſuch, as Moſes in the hiſtory of the Creation of man, can hardly finde words to expreſſe the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of his Creation, ſaying, Let us make man in our owne image; let us make man according to our owne likeneſſe: Thus God created man in his Image: In the Image of God created hee them male and female, Gen. 1.26, 27.</p>
                  <p>Thus having anſwered the objection, for a cloſe to the firſt part of the firſt Book, wee proceed to the ſecond part of this firſt Book, containing the declaration of the firſt Covenant made by God with man.</p>

God bleſſed man by his word, which was the bleſſing of his word of his firſt ſeventh dayes reſt of his Law of righteouſneſſe; and therefore the word of his firſt ſeven dayes reſt of the Law (implying the command of the whole Law) was objected to the externall ſenſes of man; for as all the commands of God (by his Word) are the neceſſary commands of the word of his ſeventh dayes reſt: So all the bleſſing of God by his word, are the neceſſary influence of his bleſſing, in the bleſſing of the word of his ſeventh dayes reſt; for by the only immediate power of that bleſſing, man is only bleſſed by God.</p>
                  <p>God having thus created and bleſſed man, male and female, God gave man power, ſoveraignty and dominion over the earth, over the creatures, next and immediately to himſelfet: And for the higher advancement of man, his immediate vicegerent on earth) God did plant the glorious garden of Ede<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                  <p>All manner of Herbs, all manner of beautifull odoriferous Flowers (which could objectively delight the externall ſenſes) no doubt muſt be in this plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Garden; the ſpecies of all which externall ſenſitive objects, did give no ſmall contentment to man, being created in ſuch actuall perfection of naturall underſtanding, while by variety of ſuch pleaſing objects, the underſtanding of man muſt be raviſhed with variety of contemplation.</p>
                  <p>In the midſt of this glorious Garden, the Tree of life, and the Tree of Knowledge of good and evill, were placed by God, both named (as it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth by Moſes) from the effect: for as by the vertue of the Tree of life, the nature of man as he is man, was to be eternally preſerved; and therefore our firſt parents might then eat thereof at their pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>So by eating of the Tree of Knowledge of good and evill, contrary to the command of God by his word (which is the command of his Law of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe) the effect of the knowledge of evill (which our firſt Parents did ſo affect to know) was produced by the eating of the forbidden fruit.</p>
                  <p>This pleaſing glorious Garden (for the pleaſure and contentment which it did afford) is commonly called by the name of Paradiſe, which word our Saviour himſelfe did uſe, for to expreſſe the joy, pleaſure and contentment of the heavenly Paradiſe.</p>
                  <p>In this pleaſing glorious Garden, God placed man, male and female, crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the ſtate of naturall and ſpirituall perfection, appointing the naturall and ſpirituall food for the eternall preſervation of the naturall and ſpirituall life of man, which was then the fruit of Trees of the Garden, whereby the naturall life of man was to be maintained; and for the ſpirituall food of man, God gave the word of the firſt ſeventh dayes reſt, for in the onely true ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall underſtanding of the word of the ſeventh dayes reſt, as God doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veale himſelfe, to be known and worſhipped by man, is the only true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, which the Lord himſelfe affirmes to be eternall life: And this is the reaſon that the word of God is called the bread of life, which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally one with the word of promiſe, which is the word of eternall life, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by

                  <head type="sub">Of the word of the firſt ſeventh dayes reſt of the Law of Righteouſneſſe.</head>
                  <p>AS by the only light of the word of every ſeverall ſeventh dayes reſt of the Law of God, in the ſeverall ſtate and condition of man, man is led in the underſtanding of God, by his word, as God hath revealed himſelfe by the word of his ſeverall ſeventh dayes reſt, to be known and worſhipped by man; ſo by the onely immediate bleſſing of God, by the word of his ſeventh dayes reſt, the ſtate and condition of man and the creatures, created for man are continued.</p>
                  <p>The word therefore of the firſt ſeventh dayes reſt was moſt neceſſary to our firſt parents, in the ſtate of their created perfection, for theſe maine rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons following:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, though Adam (being created in the ſtate of ſpirituall perfection) by the ſpirituall light of his underſtanding of the word of the Law, in his heart, really one with the ſpirituall light of the word of the firſt ſeventh dayes reſt of the Law: Adam muſt needs underſtand, that God was to be worſhipped upon the ſeventh day of the Law of righteouſneſſe; yet without the word of the firſt ſeventh dayes reſt, Adam could never have known the certain firſt ſeventh day of Gods commanded worſhip.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, without the word of the firſt ſeventh dayes reſt of the law, Adam could neither have known the formall manner of Gods commanded wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, to have worſhipped God upon the firſt ſeventh day of the Law of God; to whoſe perfect worſhip of God the eternall bleſſing of the firſt ſeventh dayes reſt of the Law, was due by the Law; by which only immediate bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the created ſtate of man, and the creatures were continued, while Adam did ſtand in the perfection of his Creation.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, without the word of the firſt ſeventh dayes reſt, no Covenant could be made by God, to binde himſelfe to man, in the word of his promiſe, or man to God, for the word of the ſeventh dayes reſt, and the word of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of eternall life (as hath been formerly delivered) are really one: for the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:49359:15"/> word of promiſe, whereby God doth bind himſelfe by Covenant to the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall continuation of the preſent eſtate of man, is enjoyed by the eternall bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the word of the ſeventh dayes reſt.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, without the word of the firſt ſeventh dayes reſt (which is really one with the word of promiſe of eternall life) as there is no covenant to bee made by God with man; ſo there was neither any object for the faith of man to reſt on, for though the eternall bleſſing of the word of the firſt ſeventh dayes reſt, was not due by the law immediately to Adams faith, but due by the Law immediately to the merit of Adams works of righteouſneſſe; yet Adams workes of righteouſneſſe, did neceſſarily proceed from his faith, in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of God of the Law of righteouſneſſe; for without faith it is impoſſible for Adam to have pleaſed God while he ſtood in his ſtate of perfection.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, without the light of the word of the firſt ſeventh dayes reſt, Adam could never have underſtood, that God was the Creator and Conſervator of man, the world, and the Creatures created for man, neither could Adam have known the formall worſhip of God, whoſe worſhip is commanded to be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that formall manner as he did reveale himſelfe by the word of his firſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth dayes reſt, according to which formall worſhip, Adam by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the firſt ſeventh dayes reſt of the Law (as it is the great command of the Law, implying the command of the whole Law) was commanded to worſhip God upon the firſt ſeventh day of the Law; for Adams ſolemn per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect worſhip of God, upon the firſt ſeventh day of the Law, was, as if all the workes of the Creation, had falne downe with Adam to worſhip God the great Creator; for as Adam was the life, ornament, and perfection of the workes of the Creation, ſo Adam was the ſum and compend of the workes of the Creation; for all the creatures of God are either of an intellectuall or corporeall nature, which were eſſentially united in the nature of man.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, without the word of the firſt ſeventh dayes reſt of the law of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, to our firſt parents, there could have been no law of God to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the obedience of man, to the command of his law, for all the power, of life, light and command, of every ſeverall precept of the whole Law, is immediately from the power of the word of the ſeventh dayes reſt, without the power whereof there is no power of any ſeverall precept of the Law, to command man, or any light for man to know that it is a precept of the Law of God: And therefore we ſee, that in the Decalogue (ſet downe to Moſes) the word of the ſecond ſeventh dayes reſt (then by the name of the Sabbath of the Lord) is placed in the end of the firſt Table of the Law, uniting (as it were) both the Tables to the ſeventh day of the Law, from whence all the ſeverall precepts of the law receive the power of life, light, and command;
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:49359:16"/> much like the laſt binding ſtone of an Arch, whereon the ſtrength and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the whole Arch doth rely and depend; for as the laſt binding ſtone of the Arch being removed, the whole Arch (as it is an Arch) muſt fall to the ground; ſo by the removing of the immediate command of God, by his word, commanding the whole law in the ſeventh day; the whole law, and the eternall bleſſing of the ſeventh dayes reſt, muſt neceſſarily fall and periſh to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, which is neceſſarily removed, while as the command of the ſeventh dayes worſhip, is attributed to the immediate authority and command of man.</p>
                  <p>The writing of the word of the ſeventh dayes reſt (as it were in the heart of the Law) in two Tables of ſtone to Moſes, is the true embleme of the word of the Law, written in the two Tables of the intellectuall and ſenſitive nature of man, in the heart of man; for as from the immediate power of the word of the ſeventh dayes reſt of the Law, life, light, and power of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand is diffuſed to all the ſeverall precepts of the Law; ſo from the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate power of the word of the Law in the heart of man, life and light is dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to all the parts and powers of man, as he is man: And this is the maine reaſon, that in the command of the word of the ſeventh dayes reſt of the law, the whole law is neceſſarily commanded, which the Lord calleth the great command of the Law, neceſſarily implying the leſſer command, which is like to the great command.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, without the command of the word of the firſt ſeventh dayes reſt (neceſſarily implying the command of the whole Law) neither Adam, or any man created in Adam (as he was the created head of all men natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to deſcend of Adam) could have tranſgreſſed the Law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.15. obliged by the firſt Covenant; for where there is no Law, there is no tranſgreſſion of the Law.</p>
                  <p>And ſo much (briefly) for the declaration of the word of the firſt ſeventh dayes reſt, upon the immediate command whereof, the firſt Covenant was eſtabliſhed between God and man, next to be declared.</p>

                  <p>GOD (according to his eternall Decree of predeſtination) having created man male and female, in this ſtate of naturall and ſpirituall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, advanced to the high love and favour of God, and to the ſoveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and dominion over the earth, and over the creatures of the earth: God entred his firſt Covenant with Adam, not with Adam, as he was a private perſon, but with Adam as created man, the head, root, and originall of all

                  <p>Adam therefore was created in ſuch admirable ſtate of naturall and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall perfection, as he was the head of the river of men, naturally to deſcend and flow from Adam the head.</p>
                  <p>The firſt Covenant therefore was made with Adam, as the created head of all men naturally to deſcend of Adam, who were all really created in the ſame naturall and ſpirituall perfection, that Adam their head was created; &amp; in who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all men were as truly &amp; really bound &amp; obliged in Adam head to the firſt Covenant, and to the command of the word of the firſt ſeventh daies reſt of the law of righteouſneſſe, in every reſpect as Adam their head, though not actually deſcended of Adam; for as all men ſinned in Adam their head, (to wit) really, ſo all men were as really and neceſſarily bound and obliged to the command of the word of the firſt ſeventh dayes reſt of the Law in Adam their head, as Adam was, as all men found by experience, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the naturall and ſpirituall perfection of Adam, the head of all men (whereby he was enabled to merit eternall life upon earth) was as really, truly, and neceſſarily due by Covenant (eſtabliſhed upon the immediate com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Law) to Adams poſterity as they ſhould actually deſcend of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, as to Adam himſelfe; for as all men were bound to the ſame reall Law in Adam their head; ſo in the juſtice of God, all men as they ſhould natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſcend of Adam, muſt be enabled with the like power of obedience with Adam their head.</p>
                  <p>The firſt Covenant made by God with man, is ſet downe by Moſes, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.16, 17. The word of promiſe of eternall life, whereby God doth binde and oblige himſelfe and man to his firſt Covenant, is in the 16. verſe, the words are, <hi>Eating, thou ſhalt freely eate of every Tree of the Garden;</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, Adam was to eate of the Tree of life; by eating whereof, Adam as he was created a naturall man, intellectuall and ſenſitive, was to live eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally upon earth; for by the doubling of the word, eating thou ſhalt eate, is ſignified an eternall eating, and by an eternall eating, an eternall living, in the ſtate and felicity wherein Adam was created.</p>
                  <p>God therefore in theſe words doth promiſe to Adam (and to all men crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in Adam naturally to deſcend of Adam) that his created eſtate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition ſhall be continued eternally upon earth, which promiſe was to be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled by God, and enjoyed by Adam, by the eternall bleſſing of the word of the firſt ſeventh dayes reſt; for by the onely immediate eternall bleſſing of
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:49359:17"/> the word of the firſt ſeventh dayes reſt; Adam, the world, and the creatures created for man, were to reſt eternally upon earth, in the ſtate and condition wherein they were created; for which cauſe, God bleſſed the firſt ſeventh day for Adam, and God ſanctified the firſt ſeventh day for his perfect wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the firſt ſeventh day by Adam.</p>
                  <p>If Adam therefore will have the actuall enjoying of the word of promiſe of eternall life, Adam muſt have it by his perfect worſhip of God upon the firſt ſeventh day of the Law, according to that formall manner that God did manifeſt himſelfe to Adam by the word of his firſt ſeventh dayes reſt, which is the condition of the Covenant.</p>
                  <p>As God therefore in his word of promiſe of eternall life, doth binde and oblige himſelfe to Adam by his Covenant, ſo God doth mutually binde and oblige Adam to the formall perfect worſhip of the firſt ſeventh day, that by the eternall bleſſing of the word of the firſt ſeventh daies reſt of the Law, Adam might enjoy the promiſe.</p>
                  <p>As God doth binde and oblige Adam, by his Covenant, to obedience, the promiſe of eternall life by his perfect worſhip of God upon the firſt ſeventh day of the Law; ſo God by his firſt Covenant, in the command of the ſeventh dayes worſhip (as it is the great command of the Law) doth likewiſe binde and oblige Adams obedience, to the command of the whole Law of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, upon a dying death, which is eternall death, ever dying, without all end of dying, contained in the 17. verſe, in theſe words, <hi>But of the Tree of knowledge of good and evill, thou ſhalt not eate of it; for in the day that thou ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt thereof, dying thou ſhalt dye,</hi> Gen. 2.17. In which words God doth binde and oblige Adams obedience to the command of the whole Law, upon a dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing death; for by the tranſgreſſion of the command of God of the Law of righteouſneſſe by his word, commanding Adam to abſtaine from eating of the fruit of the Tree of knowledge, the whole Law of righteouſneſſe is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily tranſgreſſed; for he that doth offend in one, doth offend in all, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.10.</p>
                  <p>By this negative command therefore, (neceſſarily implying the affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive command of the Law) Adams obedience is bound and obliged to the command of the whole Law of righteouſneſſe upon a dying death, which is eternall death.</p>
                  <p>Now as the promiſe of eternall life (whereby God doth oblige himſelfe and Adam mutually by his Covenant) was to be enjoyed by the eternall bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the word of the firſt ſeventh dayes reſt of the Law, the Covenant doth bind and oblige Adam to the immediate command of the Law; and the Law doth formally command Adam by the immediate power of the word of the firſt ſeventh dayes reſt, implying the command of the whole law, both upon
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:49359:17"/> the eternall bleſſing of the firſt ſeventh dayes reſt, and upon the curſe of a dying death, which is eternall death; and therefore the curſe of eternall death, is called the curſe of the Law.</p>
                  <p>The firſt Covenant being thus eſtabliſhed upon the immediate command of the word of the firſt ſeventh dayes reſt of the Law of righteouſneſſe, (im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying the command of the whole Law) between God and Adam (the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted head of all men naturally to deſcend of Adam to the end of the world:) the firſt Covenant was ratified by the Tree of life, and by the Tree of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of good and evill, placed in the midſt of the Garden of Paradiſe, as the Sacraments of the firſt Covenant, made between God and Adam, the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted head of all men; that Adam, as he was man intellectuall and ſenſitive (created in the ſtate of naturall and ſpirituall perfection advanced to ſuch fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity) by the Tree of life, might reſt ſecured, of the promiſe of God by eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life, upon his perfect obedience to the command of the Law, comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him by the power of the word of the firſt ſeventh dayes reſt; ſo Adam by the Tree of knowledge of good and evill, might reſt as aſſuredly in the promiſe of eternall death, upon his tranſgreſſion of the command of God, by his word commanding Adam, which was the neceſſary command of the word of the firſt ſeventh dayes reſt of his Law of righteouſneſſe; for God cannot command man by his word, as his word is the command of his Law of righteouſneſſe, commanding man, but as his word is the command of the word of the ſeventh dayes reſt of the Law of righteouſneſſe; for all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of God, commanding man by his word (which are the commands of his Law of righteouſneſſe) doe retain ſtrength and power of command from the immediate power of the word of the ſeventh dayes reſt.</p>
                  <p>Of this declaration of the firſt Covenant, I inferre the firſt formall oblige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Law of God, obliging man in his ſtate of perfection.</p>
                  <p>The formall obligement of the Law (obliging man in his ſeverall ſtate and condition) is immediately by the formality of the Covenant, and the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality of the covenant is by the formall manner, that God doth manifeſt himſelfe to man by the word of his ſeverall ſeventh dayes reſt of the Law, in the ſeverall ſtate and condition of man, obliging man to the formall worſhip of the ſeventh day, and in the ſeventh day obliging the obedience of man to the command of the whole law; by which formall obliged worſhip of the ſeventh day, the whole law implyed in the command of the ſeventh day is formally obliged, obliging and commanding man (in his ſeverall ſtate and condition) to the formall worſhip of God, as God by the word of his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth dayes reſt hath manifeſt himſelfe to man, both upon the eternall bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the word of his ſeventh dayes reſt, and upon the curſe of eternall
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:49359:18"/> death, and in that commanded worſhip of the ſeventh day, commanding the obedience of man to the whole Law.</p>
                  <p>God therefore by the word of his firſt ſeventh dayes reſt of the Law, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving manifeſt himſelfe to man, God of the Law of righteouſneſſe, Creator and conſervator of heaven, of earth, of man, and the creatures; by the firſt Covenant, the firſt ſeventh dayes worſhip was the formall worſhip of God of the Law of righteouſneſſe Creator and Conſervator; by which obliged for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall worſhip of the firſt ſeventh day of the law, the whole law implyed in the command of the firſt ſeventh day was formally obliged, obliging and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding man to the formall worſhip of God of the law of righteouſneſſe Creator and Conſervator, both upon the eternall bleſſing of the word of the firſt ſeventh dayes reſt, and upon the curſe of eternall death, and in that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall commanded worſhip of the firſt ſeventh day, commanding the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of man, to the command of the whole Law of God of the Law of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe Creator and Conſervator of heaven, earth, man, and the creatures created for man.</p>
                  <p>By this firſt formall obligement of the Law of righteouſneſſe (obliging man in his ſtate of perfection) the ſecond and third obligement of the law were formally diſtinguiſhed from the firſt; for the firſt obligement of the law was ſimply the law of righteouſneſſe of God the Creator, which is called the ſimple formall obligement of the law, becauſe it was without the revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſecond perſon of the Trinity, who was manifeſt to man by the word of his ſecond and third ſeventh dayes reſt, after a generall manner, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to which ſeverall manner, the law was formally obliged by two ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall Covenants, whereby the firſt ſimple formall obligement of the law of righteouſneſſe was determined, and the law of righteouſneſſe of faith in God <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <head>CHAP. IX.</head>
                  <head type="sub">Seven neceſſary concluſions inferrent of the obligement of man to the firſt Covenant.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. ADam being created in the ſtate of naturall and ſpirituall perfection, the head of all men naturally to deſcend of Adam; all men naturally to deſcend of Adam (the body of the head) were all really created in Adam the head, and in Adam the head really bound and obliged to the firſt Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, though not actually deſcended from the head.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. All men naturally to deſcend of Adam the head, being bound and obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to the Law of God in Adam the head by the firſt Covenant, Adams obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and diſobedience to the command of the law of righteouſneſſe was as truly really and neceſſarily the obedience and diſobedience of the body (to wit, the obedience and diſobedience of all men naturally to deſcend of Adam the head) as it was the obedience and diſobedience of Adam the head, though none were actually deſcended from the head: Even as we ſee the water flowing from a Conduit, the water flowing from the head, is the ſame reall water which was in the head, before it did flow from the head, which was the water of the naturall and ſpirituall life of man, ariſing from the lively ſpring of the word of the law in Adams heart naturally and ſpiritually en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened and ſanctified; Adam therefore as he was head, by his tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the law, having polluted the ſpring in the head it was the neceſſary reall act of his body, in the correlative reſpect of the head with the body, and of the body with the head.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The tranſgreſſion of the law of righteouſneſſe, obliged by the firſt Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, was without all hope of mercy known to man or Angel, for all mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy is in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, ſecond perſon of the Trinity, (who according to the eternall decree of God) was not at firſt revealed to man, created in ſuch admirable ſtate of naturall and ſpirituall perfection.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. By the denyall of the firſt Covenant made by God with man, the truth of God to man is fundamentally denyed, for it is by Gods fulfilling of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to man by his Covenant, that God doth manifeſt himſelfe truth to man.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. God (according to his eternall decree of predeſtination) having crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted man, male and female, in the naturall and ſpirituall perfection of man, God could not annihilate man, for ſo his tranſeant act had been contradictory to his imminent act.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The firſt Covenant being eſtabliſhed upon the immediate command of the word of the firſt ſeventh dayes reſt of the law of righteouſneſſe, and man
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:49359:19"/> having tranſgreſſed the Law, God could not annihilate man for his tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Law of righteouſneſſe, for ſo his juſtice could never have been ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied by man.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. God and man being mutually bound and obliged by the firſt Covenant, eſtabliſhed upon the immediate command of the word of the firſt ſeventh dayes reſt of the Law of righteouſneſſe, whereby God did binde and oblige himſelfe to Adam by the eternall bleſſing of the word of his ſeventh dayes reſt, to continue the naturall and ſpirituall perfection of Adam, upon the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall continuation of the perfection of Adams obedience; God (without higheſt in juſtice by the breach of his Covenant) could neither withdraw his actuall bleſſing from Adam (before the law was tranſgreſſed by Adam) for ſo Adam muſt neceſſarily fall under the eternall curſe of the law; neither could God by any act or decree whatſoever neceſſitate the will of man, to fall under the fearefull eternall curſe of the law, by neceſſitating his free in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectuall creature man, to a ten thouſand million of times a worſe being than if man ſhould have had no being at all.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. The firſt Covenant being eſtabliſhed between God and Adam, and Adam being left to the freedome of his election by covenant, to ſtand or fall at his pleaſure or perill, God (without infinite prejudice to his juſtice) could neither barre Satan, from tempting of Adam (created in ſuch ſtate of ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all perfection) neither could God uphold and ſupport Adam, tempted by the mighty temptation of Satan, for ſo the Covenant had not been made with man, but with God himſelfe.</p>
                  <p>Againſt the truth of that which hath been here faithfully delivered (ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from the truth of the ſacred word) it is objected, that Adam in his ſtate of perfection, was neither obliged to the Law of God, or commanded to the ſeventh dayes worſhip of God, and conſequently and neceſſarily I conclude, Firſt, Adam in his ſtate of perfection was not obliged to the firſt Covenant made by God with man; for the firſt Covenant is eſtabliſhed upon the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate command of the word of the firſt ſeventh dayes reſt of the Law of righteouſneſſe, neceſſarily implying the command of the whole Law. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, and conſequently, the firſt Covenant being denyed, the Covenant in the promiſe of the bleſſed ſeed, and the new Covenant (made with all the nations of the world) is neceſſarily denyed, which doe neceſſarily and fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentally depend upon the firſt Covenant. Thirdly, there was no law to command man in his ſtate of perfection, for the Law of God formally com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding Adam, was the word of the firſt ſeventh dayes reſt of the law of righteouſneſſe, neceſſarily implying the command of the whole law. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, neither could Adam, or any man created in Adam, tranſgreſſe the Law
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:49359:19"/> of God, for where there is no law, there is no tranſgreſſion of the law, and the ſeventh day of the law of God being denyed, there is no law of God to command man. Fifthly, and conſequently, Chriſt ſuffered the ignominious curſe of the Croſſe in vaine for the tranſgreſſion of the Law of God by man. Sixthly, by denying of the obligement of man to the command of the Law of righteouſneſſe by the firſt Covenant, the truth of God is fundamentally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed. Seventhly, and conſequently, by this denyall all Chriſtian faith is raſed from the very foundation, for the foundation of all Chriſtian faith is in the obligement of all men in Adam the head, to the firſt Covenant eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed upon the immediate command of the word of the firſt ſeventh dayes reſt of the law, and upon the tranſgreſſion of the law by man.</p>
                  <p>But the objection is proved by two ſtrong Arguments; the firſt is, that the formall obligement of the Law, now commanding man, was not ſutable to the perfection of Adam, which is moſt certaine, for neither the formall propheticall ceremoniall obligement of the law, or the formall Evangelicall obligement of the Law of righteouſneſſe of faith, was ſutable to Adam in his ſtate of perfection: But the ſimple formall obligement of the Law of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe was ſo ſutable to Adams ſtate of perfection, as the objecter, Adam, and all men created in Adam their head (for the tranſgreſſion of the Law of righteouſneſſe) were condemned by the law, to the curſe of eternall death and darkneſſe, which nothing could redeem but the ſacred Blood of the Son of God; which the objecter by denying, that Adam (in his ſtate of perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) was not bound to the law of God doth moſt unthankfully deny.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond Argument to prove this fearefull objection is this, Adam in his ſtate of perfection, had no other obligatory precept, but the command of abſtenance from eating of the fruit of the Tree of knowledge, and in the very termes of this Argument, a flat contradiction is neceſſarily involved, for this obligatory precept doth neceſſarily imply the command of the whole Law of righteouſneſſe, as hath been formerly declared; for by the tranſgreſſion of this obligatory precept, the whole Law of righteouſneſſe was neceſſarily tranſgreſſed; and therefore Adam and all men naturally to deſcend of Adam (for the tranſgreſſion of this obligatory precept) were condemned to the eternall curſe of the law of righteouſneſſe.</p>
                  <p>But of all the fearefull blaſphemous objections, which was ever objected (by the devill or man) againſt the truth of God; this may ſtand upon record for the firſt.</p>
                  <p>Thus have we finiſhed the firſt Book of our Theologicall Key, wherein the fundamentall points of the firſt Covenant are Theologically and funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally opened, for the foundation of all Chriſtian faith, containing the firſt
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:49359:20"/> part of the exercit act of the ſacred decree of predeſtination, execute by the infinite eſſentiall word, in the Creation of heaven and the Hoaſt thereof, of the earth, of man, and of the creatures created for man, and in the oblige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of man to the firſt Covenant, eſtabliſhed upon the immediate command of the word of the firſt ſeventh dayes reſt of the law of righteouſneſſe.</p>

               <p>The ſecond Covenant therefore doth containe the ſecond part of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercit act of the ſacred decree of predeſtination; in the declaration whereof the order and method ſet downe by Moſes, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. ſhall be obſerved, where firſt the tranſgreſſion of the law by our firſt parents is ſet downe: Secondly, the arraignment of our firſt parents by God for their tranſgreſſion of the law. Thirdly, the cenſure of God upon the arraignment, containing the ſecond Covenant, according to which method, this ſecond Booke ſhall be divided in theſe two parts: In the firſt part, the fall of man under the eternall curſe of the law ſhall be briefly declared: In the ſecond part, the arraignment of our firſt parents, and the cenſure of God upon the arraignment ſhall be ſet downe, containing the ſecond Covenant, neceſſarily preſuppoſing the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of the redeemed ſtate of man; firſt therefore of the fall of man from his created ſtate of perfection under the eternall curſe of the law of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, as he was obliged by the firſt Covenant.</p>
               <p>In the declaration of the fall of man, two queſtions may be moved; firſt it may be demanded, how long did our firſt patents continue in their created ſtate and felicity: Secondly, what could be the efficient cauſe of the fall of man, created in ſuch perfection &amp; advanced to ſuch high honor &amp; happines.</p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:49359:20"/>
               <p>For anſwer to the firſt queſtion; though the Scripture doth not ſet down and determine the preciſe time of the fall of man, yet there is no ground at all to imagine, that Adam did fall the ſame very day wherein he was created, for ſo Adam and all men created in Adam muſt have falne without the curſe of the Law; for before the ſeventh day that God did reſt from the works of the Creation, there was neither any formall Law or Covenant to binde or command Adam to the Law of God, which command was by the onely word of the firſt ſeventh dayes reſt of the Law of righteouſneſſe, upon the immediate command whereof the firſt Covenant was eſtabliſhed betweene God and man.</p>
               <p>But the maine reaſon of this imaginary opinion, ſtandeth in this point; to wit, Eve did, or (at leaſt) might have conceived the ſixt day which Eve was given Adam to wife; hence it is concluded, that if Adam had falne af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Eve had conceived, the conception had not been lyable to Adams ſinne, becauſe it was not then in the head, but actually deſcended from the head; in which caſe the Son (in the Juſtice of God) is not lyable to the ſin of the Father, for in this caſe the ſoule that ſinneth muſt dye: To this I anſwer.</p>
               <p>Admit that Eve had conceived the ſame night which Eve was given to Adam to wife, yet this conception was not man and the ſonne of Adam untill ſuch time as Eves ſenſitive conception was brought to ſuch perfection, as the intellectuall information of the ſoule, the ſenſitive body was perfect man and the ſon of Adam: Before which time, if Adam (the created head of all men naturally to deſcend of Adam) had falne, the poſterity of Adam (notwithſtanding) muſt have neceſſarily falne in the head, for God did not make his firſt Covenant with the ſenſitive ſeed of Adam or Eve, or with the ſenſitive conception, or with the ſenſitive body of man, but with man, Adam the head, and with all men naturally to deſcend of Adam the head, as they are men intellectuall and ſenſitiv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Before ſuch time therefore as Eve had conceived perfect man and the ſonne of Adam, Adams fall could not have been prevented from being the fall of his poſterity, all which time after the firſt Covenant was eſtabliſhed, our firſt parents might have ſtood before their fall, and yet in all that time Adams fall muſt have been the neceſſary fall of his poſterity, till the very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant time of Eves conception of man, which is by the ſecond conception of woman, while as the ſenſitive body (in the wombe) is brought to ſuch perfection, as the high elaborate vitall ſpirits of the heart, doe appetite the intellectuall forme, humane ſpirit, to be begot by the eternall Father of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and (by the power of the word) eſſentially united to the heart, whereby
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:49359:21"/> man is man, and conceived man by woman, and in the prefixed time of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall birth brought forth perfect man, by man, female the woman; though Eve in her ſtate of perfection was to bring forth man, in the image of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe and holineſſe, as in the ſecond conception, the intellectuall ſoule (eſſentially united to the heart) was to be ſpiritually enlightned and ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by God; for otherwiſe man could never be enabled to bring forth man in ſuch perfection, as man was created, to fulfill the command of the Law, by the firſt Covenant. As God therefore (by his firſt Covenant) did binde and oblige Adam, and all men created and bound in Adam, to his firſt ſeventh dayes commanded worſhip, and in that commanded worſhip, to the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of the whole Law, upon the curſe of eternall death: So God (in his Juſtice) by his firſt Covenant did oblige himſelfe to enable man to bring forth man, in ſuch ſtate and perfection as he was created, that God might be honoured and worſhipped by the perfect obedience of all men to deſcend of Adam, as he was to be worſhipped and honoured by Adam.</p>
               <p>And therefore to conclude my Anſwer to the firſt Queſtion, though the Scripture hath not ſet downe the preciſe time of Adams fall, yet by Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Adams fall muſt have been the fall of his poſterity till Eve had concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved man, though Adams ſinne had been his owne, and not the ſinne of his poſterity, if after Eve had conceived, Adam ſhould have falne. But to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, that Adam did fall the very day which he was created, it is contrary to the truth of the ſacred Word, for ſo Adam (as hath been ſaid) muſt have falne without any curſe of the Law: Neither is there ſo much as any colour of humane reaſon, to imagine, that man being created in ſuch perfection, and advanced to ſuch a large extent of honour and felicity, to be Lord over the Earth, and over the creatures, and yet that this very day man muſt fall under the fearefull eternall curſe of the Law, and be arraigned and cenſured by God for his tranſgreſſions, before man could have any time or experience ſo much as to conſider the ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:49359:21"/>
               <p>The efficient cauſe of Adams fall (by ſome moderne Theologues) is affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to bee internall and externall. That there was an externall efficient cauſe of Adams fall, it is moſt certaine, for the externall efficient cauſe of Adams fall is ſet downe by Moſes; but the queſtion of the intrinſecall or internall efficient cauſe of Adams fall, whereof there be divers opinions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Theologues, for ſome will have the internall cauſe of Adams fall to be a deficient cauſe; ſome, Adams abuſing of the freedome of his will; ſome will have the internall cauſe a true poſitive efficient cauſe, which threefold internall cauſe doth trench upon the perfection of mans creation; for if any of the three can be neceſſarily concluded, Adam muſt not be crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the ſtate of ſpirituall perfection; it doth therefore ſtand us in hand, to remove theſe three ſuppoſed internall cauſes of Adams fall, from the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of mans creation, before we come to the declaration of the fall of man; Firſt therefore to come to the firſt internall efficient cauſe, which is thus inferred.</p>
               <p>Adam by his fall produced a defective effect; the internall cauſe therefore of this defective effect, was defective internally proceeding from Adam: To this I anſwer firſt with the firſt Philoſopher. A deficient cauſe doth put no en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity in being; this effect of Adam therefore (by tranſgreſſion of the Law of God) being a true poſitive effect, muſt have a true poſitive and not a defici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent cauſe. Secondly, I anſwer Theologically, as this effect of Adam (by tranſgreſſion of the Law) was ſimply a formall morall effect; it was neither defective, or the internall cauſe, producing the formall morall effect defect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ive, which was the will of Adam; but as this formall morall effect was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by Adam; contrary to the command of God of the Law of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe by his word commanding Adam, which was the command of the word of the firſt ſeventh day of the Law of Righteouſneſſe; the formall mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall effect produced by Adam (by his contemning of the command of God) was defective morally evill, and the greateſt morall evill defective effect which was ever committed by man, for it was the morall evill effect of all men created in Adam, naturally to deſcend of Adam to the end of the world who were all bound and obliged to the firſt Covenant in Adam their head. As the defect therefore of this foule monſtrous evill effect was externall (which was the repugnance of the effect, with the command of the Law of God;) ſo the cauſe of the effect was meerly externall to Adam, which was the deceiving light of Satan, whereby Adams will was morally produced in act. The efficient cauſe therefore of Adams tranſgreſſion of the Law, was not any deficient cauſe, internally proceeding from Adam, but a true poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ernall efficient cauſe. As for the ſecond internall cauſe of Adams
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:49359:22"/> fall (which is affirmed to be Adams abuſing of the freedome of his will;) it is all one to ſay that Adams will (in his ſtate of perfection) did abuſe his will, and that his perfection did abuſe his perfection, for the created perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the will of man is in the free act of his will: Adams will therefore (by his tranſgreſſion of the Law of God) did act moſt freely, without abuſing of the freedome of his will, as it was ſimply the act of his will; but Adam by the act of his will in the tranſgreſſion of the Law of God did too freely abuſe the command of God. The third internall efficient cauſe of Adams fall, is affirmed to be the eternall decree of predeſtination, by the irreſiſtable power whereof, Adams will (in his ſtate of perfection) is affirmed to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally and ſubjectively neceſſitate to fall under the fearefull eternall curſe of the Law of Righteouſneſſe by the firſt Covenant; for it is peremptorily affirmed by the Authors and propugnators of this opinion, that God out of his alone meere pleaſure, did decree from all eternity, to elect a certaine number of men to ſalvation, and to condemne the reſt of men to the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall torments of hell without all ſubordinate reſpect to the creation of man, or to his firſt Covenant, obliging the obedience of man to his Law, or to the merit of man by tranſgreſſing of the Law; without reſpect to his Law (which is the image of the infinite eſſentiall word) or without any reſpect to the word made fleſh of the ſeed of the woman in time (and conſequently without reſpect to God himſelfe.) By the irreſiſtable power of this reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iveleſſe decree, Adams will (in his ſtate of perfection) is affirmed to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally and ſubjectively neceſſitate to fall under the eternall curſe of the Law; to the end, that way might be made for the execution of this feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full decree: But becauſe we muſt not divert (at this time) from our ſubject in hand, the examination of this miſerable, diſtracting, ſurmiſed decree, ſhall be deferred to the end of the Third Booke. In the meane time, I returne to the point.</p>
               <p>By the irreſiſtable power of this ſurmiſed abſolute decree, Adams will in his ſtate of perfection is affirmed (by the Authors and propugnators of this opinion) to be ſubjectively neceſſitate to fall under the curſe of the Law by the firſt Covenant, and conſequently and neceſſarily I do conclude, that (by this aſſertion) God is made the firſt author of the firſt and greateſt ſinne that ever entred in the world; for by the ſubjective neceſſitating of Adams will (by the pretended abſolute decree) his will was inevitably neceſſitate both morally and ſpiritually; for the morall and ſpirituall act of the will doth ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily and ſubjectively depend upon the naturall act of the will. This ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily inference is attempted (by the propugnators of the abſolute decree) to be taken away by a three-fold inſtance, whereby they doe pretend, that
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:49359:22"/> God is freed from any imputation, of being the firſt author of ſinne, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that it is affirmed, that Adams will was ſubjectively neceſſitate to fall under the eternall curſe of the Law, by the irreſiſtable power of the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute ſurmiſed decree. The firſt inſtance is this.</p>
               <p>Though Adams will (in his ſtate of perfection) was ſubjectively neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, by the abſolute decree, to fall under the fearefull eternall curſe of the Law, yet Adam did freely act, in his falling: Adam therefore notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of his ſubjective neceſſitating by the abſolute decree, Adam having freedome of election to ſtand or fall at his pleaſure, the cauſe of Adams fall is not to be imputed to Gods decree; and therefore it is a received poſition amongſt the propugnators of this opinion, that the freedome of the will of man may ſtand with internall ſubjective neceſſitating, but not with exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall coaction; and this poſition I doe contradict, and doe peremptorily affirme that the internall free act of the will of man may ſtand with exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall coaction, but no wayes with internall ſubjective neceſſitating; for though a man bee impriſoned, chained and fettered, yet the free act of his will is at liberty, to invent and deviſe the meanes to enlarge himſelf: But the internal free act of the wil being ſubjectively neceſſitate, the natural, moral, and ſpirituall freedome of mans will, is inevitably neceſſitate, for (as hath been ſaid) the morall and ſpirituall act of the will of man doth ſubjectively and neceſſarily depend upon the naturall act of the will of man; though the ſpirituall act of the will may be neceſſitate without any impeachment at all, either to the freedome of the naturall or morall action of man: As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, in the ſtate of grace, the naturall man before he be regenerate, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhut up and concluded in ſpirituall darkneſſe (called unbeleefe and ſin) is dead as he is a ſpirituall man, without any ſpirituall act of his underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and will; but the naturall man, is alive as hee is a redeemed naturall man, without any manner of neceſſitating of his will, either naturally or morally; for otherwiſe God (without higheſt injuſtice) could never bind and oblige all the nations of the world to his new Covenant, upon the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileſſe curſe of the Evangelicall Law of righteouſneſſe of faith, afterwards to be more plainly declared.</p>
               <p>The ſecond inſtance whereby God is pretended not to be the firſt au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of ſinne, (notwithſtanding that Adams will was ſubjectively ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitate by the pretended abſolute decree) is from a ſimile of a man ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding upon a lame horſe: for though the rider be the efficient cauſe of the horſes going the way which the horſe is directed by the rider; yet the rider is not the cauſe of the horſes lame going. To this I anſwer:
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:49359:23"/> If the horſe be lamed by the rider, the rider is the efficient cauſe of the horſes lame going: Now the abſolute decree is the rider, and Adam is the lame horſe, lamed by the abſolute decree; Adams will therefore being ſubject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ively lamed by the abſolute decree, Adam muſt give lame obedience to the command of God by his Law. The third inſtance followeth.</p>

               <p>THe third inſtance whereby God is pretended to be freed from being the firſt author of ſinne (notwithſtanding that Adams will was ſubjectively neceſſitate by the abſolute Decree) is pretended to be from the Scripture in theſe words, <hi>Act.</hi> 4.28. <hi>Herod, Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles, and the people of Iſrael did gather together, and doe, what thy hand and councell had deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to bee done.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From hence, and ſuch like places of the Scripture, it is concluded: Gods hand and Councell did decree and determine (from all eternity) what was done in the crucifying of man Chriſt Jeſus the Sonne of God. Gods hand and Councell therefore (from all eternity) did determine to neceſſitate A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams will (by his eternall Decree) which was the cauſe of Chriſts death.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, the inference is fallacious, and therefore for clearing of the point, it is to be underſtood, that Gods eternall Decree is the act of his will: The act of his Will, is either immanent or tranſeant to his creatures. The immanent act of his Will is his Councell and Decree, and in this ſenſe Gods Councell and Decree is God himſelfe infinite and eternall power, and his Decree eternall with himſelfe: As the act of his will (by his Councell and eternall Decree) is tranſeant to his creatures, it is the hand of his power, and his power is the power of his word of his ſeventh dayes reſt, as it is the image of the infinite eſſentiall word, power it ſelfe; his word therefore is the hand of his power, whereby the act of his will, by his eternall Councell <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>d Decree, is execute upon earth, for it is by the immediate power of his bleſſing, by the word of his ſeverall ſeventh dayes reſt, in the ſeverall ſtate and condition of man, that the word in the heart of man (whereby he liveth and moveth) is bleſſed and continued naturally, morally, and ſpiritually, and that the naturall life of the creatures created by the word, are preſerved.</p>
               <p>The word therefore of every ſeverall ſeventh dayes reſt, is the Decree of God to man; as God hath revealed himſelfe to be known and worſhipped by man, in the ſeverall ſtate and condition of man; and therefore the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:49359:23"/> Covenants made by God with man (in his ſeverall ſtate and conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) are eſtabliſhed upon the immediate command of the word of every ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall ſeventh dayes reſt.</p>
               <p>Adam therefore in his greateſt ſtate of perfection, muſt not exceed the revealed light of the word of the firſt ſeventh dayes reſt, to pry in the ſecret Councell of God, and to know what God had decreed concerning man.</p>
               <p>Now the hand of God by the power of his word, is either poſitive or permiſſive. By the hand of Gods poſitive power by his word, God doth actually and poſitively concurre with the act of his creature, whereby the decreed act of his will is execute upon earth. By the permiſſive power of his word, God doth permit the act of his creature to doe what God hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed to be done, or he doth reſtraine and divert the act of his creature as it is contrary to that which God hath decreed to be done. Gods permiſſive power by his word, in this two-fold ſenſe, is either neceſſary or free. By the neceſſary permiſſive power of his word, God (in his juſtice) doth neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily permit what he hath obliged himſelfe unto by Covenant, proceeding immediately from his eternall decree: What God doth otherwiſe permit, God doth moſt freely permit, and in this ſenſe God is ſaid to be a moſt free Agent. By the permiſſive power therefore of his word, the decreed act of his will is equally execute, as by the poſitive power of the word, in which twofold power the providence of God to his creatures doth conſiſt.</p>
               <p>God therefore (according to his eternall Councell and Decree) having created man male and female, in ſuch an admirable ſtate of naturall and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall perfection, as all the created powers of God were not able to neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitate Adams will to diſobey the command of God by his word, and God having obliged himſelfe by Covenant to Adam (and to all men created in Adam) to the continuation of the eternall bleſſing of the word of the firſt ſeventh dayes reſt, upon the eternall continuation of the perfection of Adams obedience, and to inflict the eternall curſe of the Law (by eternall death) upon Adams diſobedience to the command of his word, (which was the neceſſary command of the word of the firſt ſeventh dayes reſt) God (without higheſt injuſtice by the breach of his Covenant) could neither re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine Satan from tempting Adam, or ſupport Adam being tempted by Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan: And this was the hand of Gods neceſſary permiſſive power by his word to permit Satan to tempt Adam, Satan therefore in this temptation did doe but what Gods Councell, by the neceſſary hand of the permiſſive power of his word, had decreed and determined to be done; for God by his eternall Decree (by his Covenant) had barred himſelfe from reſtraining of Satans tempting of Adam, or from ſupporting of Adam tempted by Satan. So in
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:49359:24"/> like manner, to come to the word of the Scripture, objected by the propug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators of the abſolute Decree: God (according to his Councell and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree from all eternity) having obliged himſelfe by Covenant in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of the bleſſed ſeed (to Adam and to all men condemned to the curſe of eternall death in Adam the head) that man the eternall Son of his love Chriſt Jeſus, ſhould become man of the ſeed of the woman in time, and (by his curſed death of the Croſſe) redeemed Adam, and all men condemned in Adam, from the curſe of the Law for the ſinne of Adam: God therefore in his juſtice by his Covenant, did barre himſelfe from the reſtraining of the acts of Satan and of his cruell inſtruments in the crucifying of the Lord of life: and this was the hand of the neceſſary permiſſive power of his word, to <hi>Herod, Pontius Pilate,</hi> to the Gentiles, to the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to <hi>Judas,</hi> and to the reſt of that bloody band, <hi>Acts</hi> 4.28. who did nothing in this caſe but what Gods eternall Councell and Decree determined to be done by the hand of the permiſſive power of his word: and therefore to conclude this Point.</p>
               <p>As it had beene higheſt preſumption in Adam in his ſtate of perfection (by his contemning of the revealed light of the word of the firſt ſeventh dayes reſt) to have attempted (by any falſe light) to ſearch into the ſecret Councell of God, to know what God had decreed concerning man: So it is a moſt preſumptuous attempt in men of this age, by tranſcending and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temning the very foundation of the light of the whole Scripture of God (which is the light of the word of the firſt ſeventh dayes reſt, and of the firſt Covenant eſtabliſhed thereon) and to obtrude the fearefull light of ſuch a miſerable abſolute decree to the conſcience of man; as to affirme, that God of the Law of Righteouſneſſe (contrary to all righteouſneſſe) out of his alone meere pleaſure, without all ſubordinate reſpect, did decree to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne all the world to the eternall torments of hell, except a certaine num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of men whom hee decreed to elect and ſave; and that for the execution of this miſerable decree, God did decree (from all eternity) to neceſſitate <hi>Adams</hi> will, by the irreſiſtable power of this decree, to fall under the eternall curſe of the Law, and that without any reſpect to his Covenant made with <hi>Adam,</hi> without any reſpect to his Law, or to <hi>Adams</hi> merit by <hi>Adams</hi> tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of the Law. Thus having removed from the perfection of mans creation the obtruded internall cauſes of the fall of man, I come next to the declaration of the true efficient cauſe of the fall of man, as it is ſet downe in the ſacred Word.</p>

               <p>The externall efficient cauſe of Eves fall was principall and inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall: The principall externall efficient cauſe (as it will appeare by the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent declaration) was Satan. The inſtrumentall efficient cauſe of Eves tranſgreſſion, was, firſt the Serpent; ſecondly, the objective fruit of the Tree of knowledge of good and evill; thirdly, the words of the firſt Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.17. <hi>(dying thou ſhalt dye)</hi> though the two laſt were but cauſes by accident.</p>
               <p>The cauſes inducing Adams fall were theſe three, and Eve her ſelfe, which was the fourth cauſe.</p>
               <p>Satan therefore, that old crooked Serpent, enemy to God and man, was the principall efficient externall cauſe of the fall of man, the reſt Satan did uſe (or rather abuſe) for his inſtruments.</p>
               <p>The cauſe of Satans betraying of man, was Satans malice againſt God, and his envy to man, advanced to ſuch high honour of dominion over the earth, and over the creatures of the earth, in ſuch high love and favour of God, from whoſe love and glorious preſence Satan was diſgracefully caſt downe from the Heavens; for Satan by the infinite word, being created a moſt glorious Angelicall ſpirit, in the heighth of angelicall perfection by the power of the word of the law actually and ſpiritually enlightned (as all An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels were created) for by the immediate power of the word the Angels do live, move, intellectually and ſpiritually, and have their intellectuall and ſpirituall being: The Angels therefore, according to the internall power of the word, were obliged to the command of the Law of God as well as man; and therefore it is affirmed by the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.4. that the Angels ſinned, and ſinne being the tranſgreſſion of the Law, the Angels muſt be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to the command of the angelicall word of the Law, and conſequently and neceſſarily, the Angels by the power of the word (in the juſtice of God) muſt be enabled with equall power to fulfill the command of the Law; for as it may appeare by Satans fall, the Angels are obliged to the command of the Law, upon the curſe of eternall death, for there is but one reall word of the Law of God, obliging all the intellectuall creatures created by the word, though formally differing according to the differing ſphere of the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:49359:25"/> intellectuall creature, man in the humane ſphere is formally and humanely obliged to the Law of God; the Angels in the angelicall ſphere, formally and angelically, and both eternally obliged.</p>
               <p>Now Satan by his proud contempt of God, by his tranſgreſſion of the Law, having falne from the heighth of his angelicall perfection and felicity, wherein hee was created, under the eternall angelicall curſe of the Law; Satan was caſt down like lightning from heaven to eternall darkneſſe, <hi>Luk.</hi> 10.18. <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.12. without all hope of redemption, eternally baniſhed from the glorious preſence of God, and from the ſociety of the numberleſſe number of the bleſſed Angels, who (according to the eternall Decree of God) do ſtand in the grace of their created perfection; by the power of the Reſurrection of the word (made fleſh of the ſeed of the woman) as they were created by the power of the word, for the Lords infinite merit (by his reſt from the fulfilling of his promiſe of the bleſſed Seed) doth deſcend to the Angels, by whoſe infinite merit the Angels are conſerved in their created eſtate, as miniſtring ſpirits, for the ſafety of the Elect.</p>
               <p>By reaſon of this ſhamefull and ignominious diſgrace of Satan, by ſuch a high fall by the angelicall curſe of the Law, Satan became malitiouſly deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate againſt God: for though Satan (by the angelicall curſe of the Law) was deprived of all ſpirituall underſtanding and action, yet the angelicall intellectuall power of his underſtanding and action (which is ſo admirable) did remaine, for by this power Satan works all his miſchiefe againſt God and man: Satan therefore being puft up maliciouſly againſt God, and knowing man to be the moſt beloved creature of God, and ſeeing that man ſhould hold ſuch high ſoveraignty, and ſuch high favour and eſteeme with God, (from whoſe favour Satan had ſo diſgracefully fallen) This did ſo aggravate Satans infelicity, as that his malicious impatiency did carry him (as it were) headlong in contempt of God, to work his malice upon innocent man, and to induce man by the tranſgreſſion of the Law of God, (by the word of his Law commanding man) to fall into the like condemnation with himſelfe; for Satan (no doubt) did apprehend, that it was as impoſſible for man to be redeemed from the eternall curſe of the humane obligement of the Law, as for himſelfe to be redeemed from the angelicall curſe of the Law.</p>

               <p>THe effect of Satans project by this mighty temptation, was this in a word, Satan (by poſſeſſing of the Serpent) reſolved to ſuggeſt to our firſt parents, that there was ſuch admirable vertue in the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge of good and evill, being eaten, as their deſire and appetite to eate of the fruit, ſhould be ſo highly incenſed, as ſhould ſo darken and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure their ſpirituall light and obliged love to God, as they ſhould greedily graſpe the fruit, and eate thereof; and by eating thereof (contrary to the command of God by his Law) fall under the eternall curſe of the Law.</p>
               <p>As for the grounds which Satan went upon to ſecure his project, they were two in number; firſt, Satan did take advantage of the Covenant, for Satan did well apprehend, that the firſt Covenant, being eſtabliſhed between God and man, God (in his juſtice) could neither reſtraine Satan from temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of man, or uphold and beare out man being tempted by the mighty power of Satans temptation, which made Satan ſo audacious to aſſault man, though created in ſuch ſpirituall perfection.</p>
               <p>The ſecond ground that Satan went upon, was with equall infallibility with the former; for Satan (out of his admirable underſtanding) did well apprehend, that though man was created in ſuch ſpirituall perfection, yet that the freedome of his ſpirituall love could not determine the free act of his naturall love; and that the naturall love of man, being once united to the ſpecies of the object of his greateſt perfection, the union is inſeparable; for all creatures in their kind doe tend with an irreſiſtable propenſity to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of their perfection.</p>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:49359:26"/>
               <p>Of this Satan did take his ſecond advantage, for by his falls enlightning of the object of the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge, with ſuch a glorious gl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ſſe of ſeeming vertue and perfection (to wit) that by eating thereof, our firſt parents ſhould be equall to God; our firſt parents were betrayed; for the naturall ſpecies of the externall ſenſitive object, muſt be firſt apprehended by the act of the underſtanding, before it can be either morally or ſpiritually apprehended by man.</p>
               <p>Satans policy to ſet this project a foot, was to bring man in diſlike with God; for this cauſe, Satan (by poſſeſſing of the Serpent) did ſuggeſt to our firſt parents; firſt, that if they would but eate of the fruit, which God had commanded them (under paine of death) not to eate, they ſhould have the perfection of the underſtanding both of good and evill, and that this was the perfection of Gods underſtanding.</p>
               <p>Secondly, and conſequently, that according to the perfection of that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, they ſhould bee enabled with the freedome of independent action, which was the perfection of the free act of God, whereby they ſhould be free from the feare of any dying death, threatned by the Covenant, and in every reſpect equall to God.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that God of purpoſe had commanded them not to eate of the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge of good and evill, upon the pain of a dying death; becauſe God did know, that ſuch was the vertue of that fruit, that by eating thereof, they ſhould become equall to God himſelfe.</p>
               <p>This was of purpoſe ſuggeſted by Satan, to incenſe the love of man (who as yet knew no evill) ſo to affect the underſtanding of evill, as that without the underſtanding of evill, man ſhould apprehend his underſtanding to bee imperfect; and ſo to affect ſuch freedome of independent action, as hee ſhould be free from any danger of death threatned by the covenant. And now to make all this ariſe out of the word of the Scripture, the ſeverall paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages ſet down by Moſes, now next to be declared.</p>

               <head type="sub">The reaſon that Satan in the Serpent did begin firſt to tempt Eve, man female the woman.</head>
               <p>SAtan being to enter the liſts with man, armed with the perfection of ſuch naturall and ſpirituall underſtanding and action, Satan muſt begin to work objectively upon the externall ſenſes of man or no way, to divert the love of man from God, who were united in ſuch ſpirituall love.

               <p>Satan therefore to induce man to be in diſlike with God by his falſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving light, did abuſe the light of the Word of God and the Sacramentall ſeale of the firſt Covenant: for there was no other ſenſitive object under the heav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ns whereby Satan could then betray man by his falſe deceiving light, but by the beautifull fruit of the tree of Knowledge, Satan therefore to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe Eves love and deſire to taſte of this beautifull fruit, did make choice of the ſenſitive Serpent, for his inſtrument to gloſſe the fruit with the falſe great gloſſe of his falſe deceiving light.</p>
               <p>Though it be not expreſly ſet downe by Moſes what manner of ſenſitive creature the ſerpent was, yet by the words of the Text it doth manifeſtly appeare that the Serpent was a moſt ſubtill ſenſitive creature created by God, and in ſenſitive apprehenſion next to man; and (as it ſhall appeare afterwards) loving and converſant with man, and waiting as it were upon Eve, and therefore the more fit for Satans inſtrument. Satan did begin with Eve, and (as it may appeare by the circumſtance of temptation) out of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams hearing; wherein Satan ſhewed his wiſdome, leſt he ſhould have had the ſtrong encounter of two adverſaries, both in the ſtate of ſpirituall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
               <p>It is thought that Satans policy in beginning firſt with Eve, was becauſe of her ſex, being (as it is conceived) the weaker of the two, though I muſt ſay that there is ſmall reaſon to conceive that Eve (for her intellectuall and ſpirituall perfection) was any wayes inferiour to Adam, both being created in the like ſtate of naturall and ſpirituall perfection of man, though the one man male, and the other man female.</p>
               <p>But the reaſon muſt rather be, that Satans poiſoned cup being preſented to Adam by Eves amorous beautifull hand, the cup might be without all ſcruple freely received by Adam, for Eve was created the modell of the beauty and glory of her ſex; to whoſe love, Adams love and affection was moſt dearly and intimatly united; and herein was the devils cunning.</p>
               <p>Firſt therefore of Satans tempting of Eve, by his inſtrument the Serpent, and next of Eves tempting of Adam ſeduced by Satan in the Serpent. In Satans tempting of Eve by the Serpent, his firſt policy was by a ſubtill que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, to induce Eve to conference, to the end that by Eves reply to the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, Eve might let fall ſome words by her anſwer, for Satan to take advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to work his foule murdering deſire.</p>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:49359:27"/>
               <p>The queſtion like Satan himſelfe, was a moſt ſubtill queſtion, who for his winding every way in a man, by the ſubtilty of his temptation, is called a Serpent in the Scripture: Firſt, therefore of the queſtion moved by the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent to Eve, and next of Eves anſwer to the Serpent.</p>

               <p>SAtan in his ſubtill queſtion, by the Serpent, doth ſticke to the ſecond ground of his project, which is the freedome of the love of man to the externall ſenſitive object, enlightned by whatſoever light: The words of the queſtion are theſe (<hi>Gen.</hi> 3.1.) <hi>Yee,</hi> here the Serpent makes a pauſe, as it were, by the way of admiration, <hi>hath God ſaid, yee ſhall not eate of every Tree of the Garden:</hi> The ſenſe of the words is this, Is it true, or is it poſſible that man, whom (it ſeemeth) that God hath made Lord over the earth and crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, ſhould be barred from that freedome which is not denyed to the very ſenſitive creatures, which at their pleaſure freely eat of every pleaſing herbe agreeable to their ſenſitive nature (wherein the whole ſenſitive pleaſure and contentment of the ſenſitive creature doth conſiſt,) and muſt man (a creature both intellectuall and ſenſitive, and the Lord of the creatures) bee curbed and denyed the like freedome to eate of what fruit man hath a minde to eate of? Here was a moſt divelliſh queſtion to ſet a woman (as ſhe is a naturall woman) a longing without any further; and who is able to ſay, that Eve did not then long, by reaſon of her firſt conception, which is the ſenſitive conception of woman?</p>
               <p>Though the queſtion be cunningly and coveredly moved by the Serpent, yet if we conſider the readineſſe of Eves apprehenſion, in her ſtate of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, wee ſhall finde that Eve did apprehend the depth of the queſtion, and began to be ſenſible both of the reſtraint of her freedome, and likewiſe of death threatned by the Covenant, which two of all things under the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens are moſt averſe to the free nature of man, as hee is man intellectuall and ſenſitive.</p>
               <p>But Eve as yet doth modeſtly containe her ſelfe, and Satan in the Serpent was no leſſe wary; for Satan of purpoſe did make no mention (by his que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion) of death, threatned by the Covenant; for Satan was ſure that by the ſubtilty of his queſtion, he had given Eve ſuch a blow (being in the ſtate of perfection) as ſhe ſhould be quickly ſenſible both of the reſtraint of her free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and of death threatned by the Covenant, which innocent Eve before that time had no reaſon to think of.</p>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:49359:27"/>
               <p>Yet for all this, Eve in this Duell at firſt, like her ſelfe, did ſtoutly ſtand to the marke, containing her ſelfe within the compaſſe of her morall ſphere, actually and morally, though Eve began to faint ſpiritually; for the blow was ſo dangerous, and touched Eves freedome ſo neere, as in her anſwer to the Serpent by uttering the words of the Covenant, Eve fell ſhort, as wee ſhall heare by the words of her anſwer to the Serpents queſtion.</p>

               </p>
               <p>In theſe words, firſt Eve did give a moſt cleere teſtimony of her perfect underſtanding of God the Creator, by the word of his Law and Covenant; for in Eves acknowledging of Gods bounty and bleſſing, in allowing to our firſt parents the fruit of the Trees of the Garden (which was by the bleſſing of the word of the firſt ſeventh dayes reſt of God the Creator) Eve did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge her immediate dependence, upon the bleſſing of her gracious Creator by his word.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Eve by acknowledging Gods command, by his word com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding our firſt parents, to abſtaine from the fruit of the Tree of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, upon the paine of death: Eve did acknowledge the Soveraignty of God the Creator, over man and mans obliged obedience to God, which is the ſumme of the firſt Covenant, in theſe words; God hath ſaid (whoſe word is the command of his Law to man) <hi>Yee ſhall not eate of the fruit of the Tree in the midſt of the Garden;</hi> that is, of the Tree of Knowledge of good and evill, whoſe command we are to obey, leſt we dye (to wit) a dying death, which is eternall death. Though the temptation (by the ſubtill que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion) touched Eves freedome ſo neere, that Eve fell ſhort in the repeating of the word of the Covenant; for while as the word of the Covenant was, dying yee ſhall dye, Eve ſaid to the Serpent, we muſt not touch the fruit of the Tree in the midſt of the Garden, leſt we dye.</p>
               <p>Now death was the word, which cunning Satan in the Serpent watched for, that Eve ſhould let fall; whereat Satan in the Serpent taking advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, did give a freſh aſſault to Eve, moſt impudently contradicting the word of God by his Covenant, ſaying, <hi>Yee ſhall not dye at all;</hi> and with a breath, before Eve could reply, ſawcie Satan in the Serpent by a moſt calumnious lye againſt God, did ſecond the aſſault, ſaying, <hi>God doth know, that when ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>At which divelliſh falſe calumnious ſuggeſtion, Eve (out of the perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of her naturall underſtanding) did begin to be jealous of God, as envious of ſuch perfection and felicity to man, whereby man might be equall to God, and that ſo eaſily to be attained unto (to wit) by eating of the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge, which under the paine of death man muſt not touch; for Eve muſt have apprehended (for any thing ſhe knew) that there was as great vertue in the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge, (being eaten to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce ſuch perfection) as was ſuggeſted by the Serpent: As there was vertue in the fruit of the Tree of Life, for the eternall preſervation of man, as he is man, whereof Eve was to eate at her pleaſure, which was no ſmall reaſon for Eve to be induced by the words of the Serpent, that there was ſuch vertue in the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge; and now by the gloſſe of this great falſe light of Satan, Eves naturall love and deſire began to be ſo incenſed, as ſhe was moved to take a review of the fruit, which Eve had formerly ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten paſt with abſtinence, out of her religious love and feare to the command of her gracious Creator: And having received the fruit (enlightned by Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans falſe ſuggeſtion) the goodneſſe, beauty, and excellencie of the fruit, did ſeem in Eves conceipt and apprehenſion, to promiſe no leſſe vertue and perfection then was ſuggeſted by the Serpent, as m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Now the ſpecies of the ſenſitive object of the beautifull fruit of the Tree
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:49359:28"/> of knowledge (thus actually and ſatanically enlightned) being received in Eves underſtanding, her incenſed naturall and morall love and foule deſire to eate of the forbidden fruit (and by eating thereof to be equall to God) ariſing (like a great dark cloud, diſperſing it ſelfe thorow all the intellectuall and ſenſitive parts of her ſoule and body) Eves ſpirituall light and thankfull obliged love to God, was ſo quite darkned and obſcured, as Eve did gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily and moſt unthankfully graſp the fruit, and eate thereof: And no doubt Eve did finde the taſte and relliſh of the fruit anſwerable to the beauty of the fruit; by eating whereof, Eve ſecured her ſelfe to become equall to God, by the time that the ſuggeſted power and vertue of the fruit, ſhould by op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration produce the expected effect.</p>
               <p>By the way the Reader may here obſerve, firſt the reaſon that Satan is called that old ſerpent in the Scripture, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.11. Satan is called a ſerpent from the ſubtilty of his temptations, as he windes in at every externall ſenſe of man by his falſe deceiving light: And Satan is called the old ſerpent from this firſt temptation of man.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the reaſon may be obſerved, that Satan is called a lyer from the beginning, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.54. for this was the firſt lye that ever entred in the world, whereby Satan moſt impudently and moſt audaciouſly did belye the majeſty of God, that Satan might work his malice upon innocent man, for Satan by this falſe lye did moſt trecherouſly procure the fall of man.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the reaſon may be obſerved, wherefore Satan is called the flower of diſcord; for by Satans falſe ſuggeſtion (that man by eating of the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge ſhould become God) Eve began to fall at vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with God, for commanding man upon the paine of death not to eate of the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge: Here a queſtion may be moved: Eve being created in the ſtate of naturall and ſpirituall perfection, did not Eve perfectly know, that the Serpent was but a ſenſitive creature, and that the actuall words (uttered by the Serpent) could not be the ſerpents words, but that it may be rather conceived, that Eve by hearing of the Serpent thus ſpeaking as man, might have been afraid, and run away from the Serpent: To this I anſwer.</p>
               <p>It is without all doubt, that Eve did perfectly know that the Serpent was but a ſenſitive creature, and the rather that this creature (which is called the Serpent) was more converſant with Eve then any other of the ſenſitive crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures which ſhall plainly appeare hereafter: And there is no queſtion, but Eve did perfectly apprehend, that the words were not the naturall words of the ſerpent: And it is moſt certaine, that Eve could not imagine that the actuall words did proceed from ſatan in the ſerpent, of whoſe bewitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

               <p>But as for Eves feare of the Serpent thus ſpeaking, Eve in her ſtate of perfection could feare nothing but God alone, for ſervile humane feare is ſince the fall and redemption of man, ariſing from the diſtruſtfulneſſe and unbeleefe of man; and yet in this condition of man (under the evangelicall Law of grace) both men and women (induced by the great promiſes of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans falſe deceiving light) are not afraid while Satan (many times) doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare in deformed ſhapes: But there was no ſuch deformedneſſe in this ſenſitive creature (which is called the Serpent) for it was a moſt comely, lovely, handſome, ſenſitive creature, waiting as it were upon Eve.</p>
               <p>Thus Eve in the confidence of her new expected ſtate and felicity (by the operation of the vertue of the fruit which ſhe had eaten) joying in her heart, with what a booty ſhe ſhould preſent Adam out of her deare love and affection, that as Adam was owner of her love, ſo he might be partner of her new expected tranſcendent felicity, Eve did take of the fruit and carry to Adam.</p>

               <p>Adam therefore preſuming on Eves judgement and wiſdome (which he knew to be equall with his owne) by hearing of the ſuggeſted vertue of the fruit, ſuggeſted by the Serpent, and confirmed by ſuch apparent reaſons, Adam did begin to be as confident and as much affected with the hopefull expected felicity, of the ſuggeſted vertue of the fruit, as Eve her ſelfe, for otherwiſe all Adams love to Eve, and all Eves amorous perſwaſions of Adam, could never have induced Adam to runne upon ſo deſperate a hazzard.</p>
               <p>Wretched Adam therefore (in confidence by eating of the fruit to bee equall to God himſelfe) did take of the forbidden fruit, and eate thereof, mounting himſelfe upon the ambitious wings of ſo neere affected Deity, in flying at ſo lofty a pitch, till by the glorious ſplendor thereof, Adams ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious wings being ſcorched, Adam with his poſterity (Icarus-like) fell down in the bottomleſſe ſea of Gods eternall wrath, under the fearefull curſe of the Law, hopeleſſe, helpleſſe, eternally upon earth; and all by the miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſting of the old Serpents darkneſſe ending alwayes in afflictions, though this was the affliction of afflictions; for as Adams tranſgreſſion of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God of the Law of Righteouſneſſe was the tranſgreſſion of all men created in Adam (the head of all men naturally to deſcend of Adam to the end of the world) whereby the firſt Covenant (made betweene God and man, upon the immediate command of the word of the firſt ſeventh dayes reſt of the Law of Righteouſneſſe) was broken by man: ſo Adam and all men created and falne in Adam the head (according to the firſt Covenant) were eternally condemned by the Law of Righteouſneſſe to the curſe of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall death, without all hope of mercy or redemption.</p>
               <p>Now though it be manifeſt (by the Scripture) that by the tranſgreſſion of one precept, the whole Law of God is neceſſarily tranſgreſſed, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this precept of the forbidden fruit, tranſgreſſed by Adam, being the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary command of the word of the firſt ſeventh dayes reſt of the Law of Righteouſneſſe; for as hath beene formerly declared; the word of God commanding man, hath the onely power of command, but as it is implyed in the word of the ſeventh dayes reſt of the Law, and therefore the curſe of the Law of Righteouſneſſe was due by the Law for the tranſgreſſion of the

               <p>FIrſt, our firſt parents being condemned to the eternall curſe of the Law, for the tranſgreſſion of the command of the forbidden fruit, they were utterly diſabled from the firſt ſeventh dayes commanded worſhip, whereby the fourth precept of the firſt Table was tranſgreſſed. Secondly, our firſt parents, by following the Serpents advice, and by expecting (by eating of the forbidden fruit) to become Gods, they had other Gods contrary to the firſt precept of the Decalogue. Thirdly, the falſe deceiving words of the ſerpent, being imprinted, and (as it were) graven in the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge, to induce our firſt parents to eate of the fruit, was the firſt graven image of the devils erection, to which our firſt parents did bow and bend all the whole powers of their love and affection, contrary to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond precept of the Decalogue. Fourthly, by our firſt parents aſſenting to the Serpents blaſphemous belying of God, the ſacred Name of God was taken in vaine, contrary to the third precept of the firſt Table in which foure precepts is the ſumme of the firſt Table of the Law. Fifthly, by the tranſgreſſing of the command of the forbidden fruit, Adam and Eve did diſhonour their parents, contrary to the firſt precept of the ſecond Table, whoſe parents were the bleſſed Trinity, though the ſecond Perſon was not then revealed. Sixthly, Adam by tranſgreſſing of the command of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden fruit did kill all his poſterity, by the procuring the curſe of eternall death upon himſelfe and his poſterity, contrary to the ſecond precept of the ſecond Table. Seventhly, our firſt parents by their ſpirituall adulterous whoredome, with their idoll of the Devils erection, did commit adultery contrary to the third precept of the ſecond Table. Eighthly, Adam by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing of the curſe of the Law againſt his poſterity, did ſteale away all the naturall and ſpirituall gifts wherein they were created, which by the firſt Covenant were as due to them as to Adam himſelfe, contrary to the fourth precept of the ſecond Table. Ninthly, by our firſt parents aſſenting to the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:49359:30"/> falſe calumnious lie of the Serpent againſt God: our firſt parents did bear falſe witneſs againſt God: for the command of the fifth Precept of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond table, doth extend as well to God as to man.

               <head type="sub">The Decree of Prediſtination was not ſuſpendible by <hi>Adam</hi> though created in the eſtate of naturall and ſpirituall perfection.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>ADam</hi> being created in the ſtate of ſuch naturall and ſpirituall perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as did equall the perfection of the Law, to which he was ſo neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily obliged; it was in the freedome of <hi>Adams</hi> power, to have reſiſted Satans temptation; by reſiſting whereof, the Decree of Predeſtination had been ſuſpended. It is therefore concluded by the Authors and maintainers of the abſolute Decree, that there was a neceſſity, that the freedome of <hi>Adams</hi> will, muſt be neceſſitate by the abſolute Decree, to yeeld to the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Satan, leſt the Decree of Predeſtination ſhould be ſuſpended.</p>
               <p>I anſwer to the Objection: It is true, that <hi>Adam</hi> was created in ſuch eſtate of naturall and ſpirituall perfection, as did equall the command of the Law; but this perfection was with equall freedome of naturall, morall and ſpirituall action, without the determining of the act of the one by the act of the other, as hath been formerly declared. <hi>Adam</hi> therefore, in reſpect of his freedome of election, had the power to be induced, or not induced, by Satans temptation before <hi>Adam,</hi> was tempted by Satan. But <hi>Adam</hi> love (by Satans falſe deceiving light) being once united, to the externall object of the fruit of the tree of knowledge, <hi>Adams</hi> fall by eating of the fruit, was irreſiſtible, and that for this twofold impregnable reaſon.</p>
               <p>Firſt, the externall object actually enlightened (by Satans falſe light) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the object of <hi>Adams</hi> greateſt perfection (for <hi>Adam</hi> by eating of the fruit was ſuggeſted to be equall to God) <hi>Adams</hi> love, and the object of his grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt perfection, being actually united: The union was inſeparable and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſiſted by any increated or created power: For God had barred him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by covenant, either from reſtraining of Satan from tempting <hi>Adam,</hi> or from bearing up of <hi>Adam</hi> being tempted by Satan, neither was there any created power of God that could ſeparate or neceſſitate the freedome of <hi>Adams</hi> naturall love from the naturall object, or <hi>Adam</hi> muſt not be created
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:49359:31"/> man in the ſtate of naturall perfection, whoſe love muſt be with all free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to the naturall object.</p>
               <p>Secondly, there being nothing under the heavens more averſe to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of man, (both as he is an intellectuall, and as he is an naturall man in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectuall and ſenſitive) then eternall death (which is the deſtruction of the perfection of man;) Adams naturall love therefore being united to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall object, whereby he might avoid eternall death, the union was inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perable and irreſiſtable.</p>
               <p>So long therefore as Satan (by his mighty power) was left at ſuch liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, there was ſmall reaſon to invent any imaginary decree, to neceſſitate Adams will to fall under the eternall curſe of the Law. Though by this act of Satan his power was ſo curbd and limitate, that Satan ſhall never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive all men againe at a clap, as we ſhall heare afterwards.</p>
               <p>One queſtion doth remaine to be reſolved, which is preſt by many, the queſtion is this: Could not God have created man with ſuch neceſſity of ſpirituall action, as man could not have beene tempted by the mightieſt temptation of Satan, to fall from his obliged love to God? I anſwer.</p>
               <p>It is all one to move this queſtion, as to move the queſtion, whether God could create another God? For firſt, no intellectuall creature (as it is a creature) can bee created with neceſſity of ſpirituall action; for by ſuch Creation, God muſt communicate his owne ſpirituall indiviſible eſſence to his creature; though the action of God is not neceſſary by nature, as wee ſay of the fire, (which out of the neceſſity of its nature) doth neceſſarily burne; but Gods immanent action is ſaid to be neceſſary, as he is infinite immutable and eternall, as by his tranſeunt action God is ſaid to be a moſt free Agent.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I anſwer to the Queſtion, that ſuch creation of man by God, with neceſſity of ſpirituall action, had implyed a manifeſt contradiction; for ſo man muſt have beene created, dependent by his creation, and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent by his ſpirituall action. And ſo much briefly for the fall of man under the eternall curſe of the Law, which is the contents of the firſt Part of this ſecond Booke.</p>

               <head type="sub">The redemption of man from the fearefull eternall curſe of the Law for the ſinne of Adam.</head>
               <p>VVE ſhould next (according to our method) ſet downe the arraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our firſt parents by God, and the cenſure of God upon the arraignment containing the ſecond Covenant.</p>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:49359:31"/>
               <p>But becauſe the arraignment, cenſure, and ſecond covenant, doth neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily preſuppoſe the redemption of man, from this fearfull curſe of the Law (to which <hi>Adam,</hi> and all men naturally to deſcend of <hi>Adam</hi> were eternally condemned): the redemption of man therefore, is firſt to be declared: For, though (according to the eternal decree of God) the actuall curſe of the Law for the ſin of <hi>Adam</hi> was never, neither ſhall it be ever actually inflicted upon <hi>Adam,</hi> or any man naturally to deſcend of <hi>Adam;</hi> yet ſo much was neither known to man or Angel before the Promiſe of the bleſſed ſeed was made to <hi>Adam,</hi> and to all men eternally redemed in <hi>Adam</hi> the head, by the ſecond covenant. And therefore all the puniſhments inflicted by God, by his cenſure upon our firſt parents for the tranſgreſſion of the Law, were all temporall in this life, while as the curſe of the Law is eternall: For, firſt, if the curſe of the Law had been actually inflicted by God upon our firſt parents, as they and their poſterity were actually condemned to the curſe, it had been impoſſible for our firſt parents to have anſwered God upon their arraignment as they did, though their anſwers were untowardly enough. For their anſwers (as we ſhall find) was as the anſwer of a meer naturall man, without any manner of ſpirituall underſtanding or action.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it had been impoſſible for God (in this caſe) to have called our firſt parents ſo mercifully by his Word; but moſt impoſſible for God to have entred any covenant with man, under the actuall curſe of the Law; in which caſe the eternall curſe of the Law is mercileſs: For God can ſhew no mercy to man condemned to the curſe of the Law, without a Mediator to intervene between the condemnation of man by the Law, and the actuall inflicting of the curſe. The redemption of man therefore, from the curſe of the Law, is, firſt, to be declared before the arraignment of our firſt parents, before the cenſure of God upon the arraignment, and before the ſecond covenant.</p>
               <p>The redemption of man from the curſe of the Law, for the ſin of <hi>Adam,</hi> is to be conſidered after a twofold manner: Firſt, the redemption of man is to be conſidered, as it was the promiſe of God made to <hi>Adam,</hi> and to all men naturally to deſcend of <hi>Adam,</hi> in the promiſe of the bleſſed ſeed by the ſecond covenant, which is contained in the reſt of this ſecond Book. Secondly, the redemption of man is to be conſidered, as the promiſe of the bleſſed ſeed was fulfilled by the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, upon the day of his reſurrection, upon which bleſſed day the new covenant was made by God with all the Nations of the world, which is declared in the third book of this Theologicall key.</p>
               <p>For the better conceiving both of the ſecond Covenant (which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the old Covenant) as alſo of the New Covenant; theſe three maine fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall points are neceſſarily to be underſtood.</p>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:49359:32"/>
               <p>The firſt, the eternall Decree of God, whereby the redemption of man was decreed from all eternity. The ſecond point is the perfection of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of man, and wherein the perfection of the redemption of man doth conſiſt. The third point is the admirable benefits, ariſing to all the nations of the world, by the perfection of the redemption of man, from the curſe of the Law for the ſin of <hi>Adam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, therefore of the eternall Decree of God. God, out of his infinite love and mercy to man, (in his Son Chriſt Jeſus) upon his eternall preſcience of the inevitable fall of man, by the mighty malicious temptation of Satan, did from all eternity decree, to predeſtinate to the curſed Altar of the croſs, the only Son of his love, Chriſt Jeſus, (begot man of the ſeed of the woman in time, as he is man, the eternall Son of God, before all time) to redeem man from the eternall curſe of the Law for the ſin of <hi>Adam,</hi> by his curſed death of the croſs; that as Satan in the Serpent did firſt ſo maliciouſly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray the woman, to procure the fall of man: So by the reſurrection of the bleſſed ſeed from the dead, the head of the old Serpent Satan, and his curſed ſeed (for his malicious betraying of the woman) ſhould be broke in the great day, to his eternall confuſion: For which cauſe, firſt, God decreed from all eternity, to enter his ſecond covenant with man, in the promiſe of the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſeed; that the bleſſed ſeed ſhould reſt from the redemption of man from the curſe of the Law for the ſin of <hi>Adam</hi> upon the ſeventh day of the laſt Sabbath from end to end; that by his fulfilling of the whole Law in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day, the whole Law might be fulfilled, as he did bind and oblige him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to man by covenant; by fulfilling whereof, the firſt ſeventh dayes eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall reſt, (loſt by <hi>Adams</hi> tranſgreſſion of the Law) might be due to his merit by the Law, that the eternall bleſſing of the next ſeventh dayes reſt, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demeed ſtate of man might be continued.</p>
               <p>Secondly, God by his eternall decree, did decree to bind and oblige him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to man, to fulfill the promiſe of the bleſſed ſeed by his reſurrection from the grave, and to enter his new covenant with all the nations of the world.</p>
               <p>As God did decree from all eternity to bind and oblige himſelf to man in the promiſe of the bleſſed ſeed, by the ſecond covenant: So God decreed from all eternity, to bind and oblige man, mutually by his ſecond covenant, to believe in his promiſe of the bleſſed ſeed; both upon the eternall bleſſing of the word of the ſecond ſeventh dayes reſt of the Law of righteouſneſs of faith, and likewiſe upon the eternall mercileſs curſe of the law of faith.</p>
               <p>The promiſed redemption of man therefore, in the promiſe of the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſeed, (by the ſecond covenant) was as effectuall and actuall to <hi>Adam,</hi> and to all men naturally to deſcend of <hi>Adam</hi> the head, untill the promiſe was
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:49359:32"/> fulfilled; as it was effectuall and actuall in the fulfilled promiſe by the new covenant to all the nations of the world.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Adam</hi> therefore, and all men naturally, to deſcend of <hi>Adam,</hi> (by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed word of the Law literally written in the the heart of man) were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily inabled with the power of naturall life and light; and with the power of the life and light of righteouſneſs of faith, to believe morally in the promiſe of the bleſſed ſeed; as they were oblieged by covenant, though by the eternall Decree of God, <hi>Adam</hi> and all men redeemed in <hi>Adam</hi> the head, from the curſe of eternall death and darkneſs, were ſhut up and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in temporall darkneſs called unbelief and ſin, till they be regenerate, afterwards to be declared: from this enabling of man, with the life of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of faith to believe the promiſe of the bleſſed ſeed, the Law of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes, was firſt called the Law of righteouſnes of faith; for by the formall obliegement of the Law by the ſecond covenant, the formall ſimple obliege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Law of righteouſneſs, was actually determined by the command of the word of the ſeventh day of the Law of righteouſneſs of faith in the promiſe of the bleſſed ſeed.</p>
               <p>By this decreed work of the redemption of man (by predeſtinating the Lamb of God to the curſed altar of the croſs for the ſin of man) the ſacred Decree of God, doth principally take the name to be called, The eternall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of Predeſtination, as from the more noble and excellent part, ſo far ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounting the works of the creation, as the ſacred blood of the Son of God doth ſurmount the excellency of all the creatures created by God. And ſo much for the eternall Decree of Predeſtination for the preſent: Next the perfection of the redemption of man is to be declared.</p>

               <p>AS God by his decree from all eternity did decree (by the curſed death of the promiſed bleſſed ſeed, made fleſh of the ſeed of the woman) to redeem all men from the curſe of eternall death and darkneſs (to which all men were eternally condemned in <hi>Adam</hi> the head;) So God from all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity did decree to ſhut up and conclude all men redeemed in <hi>Adam</hi> the head in temporall ſpirituall darkneſs till they be regenerate, which is called unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief and ſin; and therefore it is ſaid, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.32. that God did conclude all men in unbelief, (which is ſpirituall unbelief, proceeding from that ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all darkneſs) that he might have mercy upon all men, (to wit) by enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:49359:33"/> of that ſpirituall darkneſs, by the grace of ſpirituall faith in the act of regeneration.</p>
               <p>In which two points, the perfection of the redemption of man doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt: Firſt therefore, of the perfection of the redemption of man from the curſe of eternall death and darkneſs. And ſecondly, of the ſhutting up, and concluding of all men (redeemed from the curſe of eternall death and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs) in temporall ſpirituall darkneſs (called unbelief and ſin) according to the eternall Decree of God.</p>
               <p>The perfection of the redemption of man (condemned to eternall death and darknes) is by the intervention of the curſed death of the Word made fleſh of the ſeed of the woman, between man condemned to the curſe of the Law, and the actuall inflicting of the curſe by God, upon the word of the Law, and life of righteouſneſs written in the heart of man, whereby man was inabled with the power of naturall life and light, and with the power of the life and light of righteouſneſs before his fall.</p>
               <p>By which intervention of our Saviour, by his ſuſtaining of the actuall curſe of the Law due to man condemned by the Law: the word of the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall life of man, and of the life of righteouſneſs (writen in the heart of man) and conſequently man is redeemed from the curſe of eternall death and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and by the power of the redeemed word in the heart of the redeemed man: The naturall man is naturally and morally inabled again to live the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall life of man, and the life of righteouſneſs of faith, to believe firſt in the gracious promiſe of the bleſſed ſeed by the old covenant, and now to believe in the fulfilled promiſe by the new Covenant.</p>
               <p>As Adam therefore, and the Fathers, by the literall light of the Word of the ſeventh dayes reſt, of the Law of righteouſneſs of faith (then by the name of the Sabbath of the Lord, which was really one with the literall light of the redeemed word, of the Law and life of righteouſneſs of faith in the heart of man) were morally enabled to believe the promiſed reſt of the bleſſed ſeed from the redemption of man from the curſe of the Law; for the ſin of Adam upon the Sabbath, and by the power of the word of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of faith in their heart, were inabled to bring forth the morall and cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall works of faith, according to the formall command of the Law of faith. So now, by the power of the redeemed word of the law of Faith (written in the heart of man, really one with the word of the ſeventh dayes reſt of the Evangelicall Law of righteouſneſs of faith) the redeemed natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall man is morally inabled to believe the fulfilled promiſe of the bleſſed ſeed, and to bring forth the morall works of faith according to the command of the word of the ſeventh dayes reſt of the Evangelicall Law of righteouſneſs
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:49359:33"/> of faith. And therefore, though the redeemed naturall man, (from the curſe of eternall death and darkneſs) be ſhut up and concluded in temporall ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall darknes (till he be regenerate) and dead, as he is a ſpirituall man, without any manner of ſpirituall underſtanding or action, and neceſſitate to ſpirituall unbelief; yet the redeemed naturall man is not ſhut up and concluded in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall and morall darkneſs, and dead, as he is a naturall man, neceſſitate to morall unbelief; but by the power of the redeemed word, written in the heart of man: The naturall man is alive, with freedome of naturall and morall grace (by the act of his underſtanding, will, and ſenſes) to believe the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of the bleſſed ſeed by the old covenant; and the fulfilled promiſe by the new covenant; for the word of the Law of righteouſneſs of faith (obliged both by the old and new covenant,) is firſt and immediately morally com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, though neceſſarily implying the ſpirituall command, and that as well upon the mercileſs curſe of the Law of Faith, as upon the eternall bleſſing of the word of the ſeventh dayes reſt of the Law of righteouſneſs of faith.</p>
               <p>If the redeemed naturall man therefore, were concluded, and neceſſitate to morall unbelief, as (by his concluding in ſpirituall darkneſs) he is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitate to ſpirituall unbelief: Firſt, it were impoſſible for the redeemed na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall man to give morall obedience to the command of the Law of faith, obliged either by the old or new covenant. But more impoſſible for God (in this caſe) to make his old or new covenant with man: For, it were high injuſtice in God, to oblige man (redeemed from the curſe of the Law for the ſin of Adam) to believe his promiſe upon the mercileſs curſe of the Law of faith; while the redeemed naturall man (in the mean time) was neceſſitate, both to morall and ſpirituall unbelief.</p>
               <p>Secondly, in the free naturall and morall act of the underſtanding, will, and ſenſes of the redeemed naturall man, (which naturall and morall act is really one, though formally differing) the perfection of the redemption of the naturall man (as he is man intellectuall and ſenſitive) doth conſiſt; which being neceſſitate man is no man.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, ſuch morall neceſſitating of the redeemed will of man, (and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently of his externall ſenſes) doth inferre a neceſſary contradiction in the act of the redemption of the naturall man: for by the literall light of the redeemed word of the Law and life of righteouſneſs of faith written in his heart, (really one with the literall light of the word of the ſeventh dayes reſt of the Law of righteouſneſs of faith) the naturall man is morally inabled to believe the word preached (for the literall light of the word is in the ſound of the word) and therefore it is ſaid, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.17. that <hi>Faith</hi> (which is morall faith) <hi>is by the hearing of the Word.</hi> And by the neceſſitating of the morall
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:49359:34"/> act of the underſtanding, will, (and conſequently of the ſenſes) of the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall man, he is neceſſitate to morall unbelief; which is a manifeſt contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction. Hence I inferre theſe ſeven Theologicall neceſſary concluſions:</p>
               <p>Firſt, the redeemed naturall man, by the redeemed word of the Law, and life of righteouſneſs of Faith, written in his heart (which is of one reall light and command, with the eternall light and command of the word of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth dayes reſt of the Law of righteouſneſs of Faith) the redeemed naturall man, is morally inabled with the grace of morall faith, to believe the word of promiſe (which is really one with the word of the ſeventh dayes reſt of the Law of righteouſneſs of Faith:) Firſt, in the promiſe of the bleſſed ſeed (by the old covenant) and now by faith in the fulfilled promiſe (by the new covenant) made with all the nations of the world.</p>
               <p>Secondly, and conſequently, by the power of the redeemed word of the Law, and life of righteouſnes of Faith, (written in the heart of the redeemed naturall man) the naturall man is morally inabled to bring forth the works of morall faith, according to the formall command of the Law of Faith, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any manner of neceſſitating of his will, to morall diſobedience by the temptation of Satan or his inſtruments; for, if either Satan, or any created power of God, could neceſſitate the will of the redeemed man to morall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience: God in his juſtice could never oblige man to the command of his Law, upon the curſe of eternall death, either by the old or new covenant. Though Satan therefore be neceſſitate to tempt man, (as ſhall be declared hereafter) yet Satan with all his power, muſt either induce the redeemed na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall man, freely and willingly to diſobedience, or no way.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the redeemed naturall man, by the power of the light of the word of the Law, and life of righteouſneſs of faith in his heart, (really one with the literall light of the word of the ſeventh dayes reſt of the Law of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Faith) is morally inabled to know when he doth tranſgreſſe the Law of faith, by bringing forth the works of unbelief and unrighteouſneſs by his actuall ſins, and to repent him of his actuall ſins, for fear of the curſe of the Law: For the grace of morall faith, doth neceſſarily preſuppoſe the grace of morall repentance. And this is the reaſon that from the promiſe of the bleſſed ſeed, (throughout the old and new Teſtament) all men are continually called upon, to forſake their actuall ſins and unrighteouſneſs, and by repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to turn and reconcile themſelves to God; for all naturall men (by the perfection of their redemption) are inabled with the morall grace of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, without any manner of neceſſitating of their impenitency, by the power of Satan or his inſtruments: For the grace of morall repentance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neceſſitate, the grace of morall faith is likewiſe inevitably neceſſitate.</p>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:49359:34"/>
               <p>Fourthly, the redeemed naturall man, being morally inabled with the grace of morall faith and repentance, without any manner of neceſſitating of his will to morall unbelief and impenitency: The grace of ſpirituall faith is promiſed (by the old and new covenant) in God prefixed time, to the continuation of his morall obedience, by the morall works of faith: For, <hi>Mark</hi> 13.13. <hi>Whoſoever ſhall continue to the end ſhall be ſaved.</hi> This end to the naturall redeemed man, is the prefixed time of Gods ſpirituall calling, by ſpirituall faith: For by ſpirituall faith, the naturall redeemed man is ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from the ſecond death, which is the curſe of the Law of righteouſneſs of faith; as (by the curſed death of Chriſt Jeſus, the Son of God, as he is man) naturall man is ſaved from the firſt death, which is the curſe of the Law of righteouſneſs for the firſt ſin of Adam.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, though Satan and his wicked inſtruments, cannot neceſſitate the will of the redeemed man, morally to diſobedience: yet Satan (by his falſe deceiving light) can induce and betray man, (without Gods ſpeciall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſive grace) to tranſgreſſe the Law of righteouſneſs of faith by his works of unbelief and unrighteouſneſs; and to draw down the evill reward of the Law, by ſore afflictions proceeding from the wrath of God, upon the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall man for his tranſgreſſion of the Law. The redeemed naturall man there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (by the power of the redeemed word of the Law, and life of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of faith in his heart) is inabled with the morall grace and gift of morall prayer, to call upon the Lord in the day of affliction and trouble, who hath promiſed to hear the prayer of the redeemed naturall man. And therefore, the Lord ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.15. <hi>Call upon me in the day of trouble, and I will hear thee;</hi> for prayer is one of the principall works of worſhip, and a chief work of faith.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, the naturall and morall bleſſing of the word of the ſeventh dayes reſt of the Law of righteouſneſs of Faith is morally due by the Law to the redeemed naturall mans morall faith, by the immediate power of which bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, the naturall mans power to produce his morall good works of faith is continued. Though the good morall action therefore of the redemed natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall man, be neceſſary ſpirituall ſin, by reaſon of his concluding in ſpirituall darkneſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, which is ſpirituall unbelief, (for whatſoever is not of ſpirituall faith, is neceſſarily ſpirituall ſin) yet the good morall action of the naturall man is not actuall ſpirituall ſin; for ſo God muſt be the firſt author of actuall ſpirituall ſin ſince the fall, which is blaſphemy to affirm: For this ſpirituall ſin is not by the poſitive act of the will of man, but from the will of God, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his eternall Decree, by concluding man in ſpirituall unbelief, which is called ſin, for the reaſons ſet down in the Chapter following. But
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:49359:35"/> this ſpirituall unbelief, (proceeding of the ſpirituall darkneſs) wherein all redeemed men are concluded, is not actuall ſin: For actuall ſin is the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of the Law, which is the only ſin that condemnes man: For as the Law of righteouſneſs of Faith doth command the works of Faith: So the Law doth condemn the works of unbelief, whereby the Law is tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed by man; we muſt therefore diſtinguiſh between the good morall action of the naturall man, as it is ſpirituall ſin, for want of ſpirituall faith; and the morall evill action of the naturall man, which is both actuall morall and actuall ſpirituall ſin; for there is but one Law of God (as God is one) literally and ſpiriritually commanding man, and conſequently the morall tranſgreſſion, is a neceſſary ſpirituall tranſgreſſion of the Law. The good morall action therefore, of the naturall man (according to the literall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Law cannot be actuall ſpirituall ſin; for the naturall man (being ſhut up in ſpirituall darkneſs) is dead as he is a ſpirituall man, and therefore the naturall man, as he is a ſpirituall man, being dead, is freed from the Law of actuall ſin: And his morall good action, proceeding from his morall faith, being without either morall, or ſpirituall actuall ſin: The mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall bleſſing of the word of the ſeventh dayes reſt of the Law of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Faith is as due by the Law to his morall faith, as the ſpirituall bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing is due by the Law, to the ſpirituall faith of the regenerate man: For as the Law is firſt and immediately literally commanded; ſo the bleſſing of the word of the ſeventh dayes reſt, is firſt immediately due by the Law to morall faith, which muſt neceſſarily precede ſpirituall Faith in the ordinary calling of God.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, though the naturall man, do too often ſtumble and fall by the temptation of Satan and his inſtruments; yet he hath all the dayes of this life to repent him of his actuall ſins; for the arms of Gods mercy are out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtretched all the dayes of his life, to imbrace the repenting ſinner: And therefore is ſaid, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.21, 22. <hi>At what time ſoever a ſinner doth repent him of his ſins from the bottome of his heart, I will put away all his ſins out of my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance:</hi> As the naturall man therefore, muſt not deſpair of Gods mercy in his Son Chriſt Jeſus, which is the greateſt ſin that can be committed by man, proceeding from unbelief; for by deſparing in the mercy of God, wretched man doth detract from the infiniteneſs of the Lords merit: So it is one of the moſt fearfull ſins for wretched man, by continuing in actuall ſins and wickeneſs, to preſume on the mercy of God; while by his contemning of the long patience of God, (leading him ſo graciouſly to repentance) God (in his juſtice) doth moſt juſtly give him over to a reprobate minde, that though he hath all the dayes of this life to repent, yet he cannot repent. And
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:49359:35"/> this is the reaſon that it is ſaid, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.13. from him that hath not, that which he hath ſhall be taken from him; that is, the grace of morall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, which he hath by the power of the redeemed word of the Law and life of righteouſneſs of faith written in his heart. And now to conclude, the perfection of the redemption of the naturall man, by the curſed death of the Son of God, Chriſt Jeſus, as he is man.</p>
               <p>Though the redeemed naturall man (according to the eternall decree of God) <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.31. be ſhut up, and concluded in ſpirituall darkneſs, till he be regenerate, called unbelief and ſin; yet the redeemed naturall man by the immediate power of the word of the Law, life and light of righteouſneſs of Faith (neceſſarily implying the power of naturall life and light) written in the heart of the redeemed naturall man; the naturall man is inabled to live the naturall life of man, and the life of righteouſneſs of faith morally, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any manner of any neceſſitating of the act of his underſtanding, will or ſenſes, either naturally or morally.</p>
               <p>Whoſoever therefore doth preſume to deny the freedome of the will of the redeemed naturall man, either naturally or morally, doth neceſſarily deny the perfection of the redemption of man, by the curſed death of the eternall Son of God, Chriſt Jeſus, as he is man.</p>
               <p>The eternall death and darkneſs (to which all men in Adam the head, were condemned) was prefigurate by the darkneſs of the firſt Tabernacle, called the Holy place, which was made cloſe and dark, without any light at all. And the redeemed naturall life and light of man, and the life and light of righteouſneſs of faith; to which all men are inabled by the curſed death of Chriſt Jeſus (the eternall Son of God made fleſh of the ſeed of the woman) was prefigurate by the loaves upon the Table of ſhew-bread, and by the glorious lights of the golden Candleſtick, placed in the firſt Tabernacle; for the lamps of the golden Candleſtick were enlightened by the fire of the brazen Altar, prefigurating the curſed altar of the Croſs whereon the Lamb of God was to be offered. And the fire of the brazen altar, whereby the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locauſt ſacrifice of the Lamb was burned up; did come down from heaven, which did prefigurate the fiery wrath of God, whereby the Lamb of God was to be burned up upon the curſed altar of the croſs for the ſins of man. And ſo much for the perfection of the redemption of man condemned to eternall death and darneſs. Next of the concluding of all men redeemed in temporall ſpirituall darkneſs, called unbelief and ſin.</p>

               <p>IN the concluding and ſhutting up of all men in ſpirituall darkneſs and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.32. and in the ſpirituall enlightening of that ſpirituall darkneſs, ſtandeth the very period of the perfection of the redemption of man; and therefore it is ſaid, that God did conclude all men in unbelief, that he might have mercy upon all: For, though God hath mercy upon all by the firſt grace of morall faith, to which all men are inabled by the immediate power of the redeemed word of the Law and life of righteouſneſſe of faith, written in the heart of the redeemed man; yet his ſpeciall mercy is in his ſecond grace, which is by the enlightening of the ſpirituall darkneſſe (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the redeemed naturall man is ſhut up) with the ſpirituall light of the holy Spirit, whereby the naturall man is inabled with the grace of ſpirituall faith; without this concluding of man therefore in ſpirituall darkneſſe, and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall unbelief, which is called ſin, it is impoſſible that any naturall man (in the ordinary calling of God) could be ſpiritually called by the grace of ſpirituall faith; by the only grace whereof man is ſaved from the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond death. By this ſpirituall light, inlightening of the darkneſſe of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of man, in the immediate act of ſpiritual regeneration, the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the naturall man, is firſt, ſpiritually inlightened, to ſee himſelf, dead, both in actuall morall, and actuall ſpirituall ſin, under the curſe of the Law of Faith, which he could never ſee before: For though the naturall man, before he be regenerate, cannot ſin actually and ſpiritually, as he is a ſpirituall man, (being dead in ſpirituall darkneſſe) yet the naturall man by his morall evill action, doth ſin actually, both morally and ſpiritually; though the naturall man before he be regenerate, cannot know that his morall evill action is a neceſſary ſpirituall tranſgreſſion of the Law: For, from the firſt evill morall action of the naturall man (which is a neceſſary tranſgreſſion of the Law of faith) the naturall man, till he be regenerate, is condemned by the Law of Faith, and dead by the Law in actuall ſin, as he is a naturall man, till he be raiſed by the grace of ſpirituall Faith; for all actuall ſin doth begin morally, by the morall tranſgreſſion of the Law, which is both a morall and ſpirituall tranſgreſſion, as the Law is morally and ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally commanded: But the pardon and remiſſion of actuall ſin, doth begin ſpiritually by ſpirituall faith, untill which time the naturall man is neceſſarily dead in actuall ſin, though he doth not, neither can know, that he is dead in
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:49359:36"/> actuall ſin, till his ſpirituall darkneſſe be ſpiritually inlightned: And therefore the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.9. ſaith, <hi>I was once alive without the Law</hi> (to wit, while as he knew not the ſpirituall command of the Law) but when the command came, (that is, the ſpirituall command, which came by the ſpirituall enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of his ſpirituall darkneſſe by ſpirituall faith) ſin revived, and I dyed: For, then the Apoſtle did ſee himſelf dead in actuall ſin.</p>
               <p>All naturall men therefore; (before they be regenerate) are dead in actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ſin. And in this ſenſe, our Saviours words are to be conceived, while as he ſaith, <hi>Luke</hi> 9, 60. <hi>Let the dead go bury their dead.</hi> By the ſpirituall light therefore, in the immediate act of regeneration: the naturall man is ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally inlightned, to ſee himſelf dead in actuall, morall, and ſpirituall ſin; and ready to ſinck in the bottomleſſe ſea of Gods fiery wrath for ſin, under the eternall curſe of the Law of Faith, while in the mean time, he is led (by this ſpiritually light) to lay faſt ſpirituall hold on the Lords infinite merit; by which ſpirituall hold, the faith of the naturall man proceeding from his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall love, and the Lords merit, by his love to the naturall man, are really ſpiritually and diviſibly one; by which ſpirituall union, the naturall man is actually and ſpiritually regenerate, and myſtically united to his myſticall head, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, by whoſe infinite merit, all the regenerate mans finite actuall ſins are covered: For, by this ſpirituall union, the Lords merit (by his fulfilling of the Law) is made the regenerate mans merit by imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and imputed to his ſpirituall faith, whereby the regenerate man is juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the Law, by our Saviours fulfilling of the Law: And by this ſpirituall union, inabled to live the ſpirituall life of righteouſneſs and holineſſe of faith. And therefore it is ſaid, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.17. <hi>The juſt ſhall live by faith:</hi> And this is the faith which is able to remove the greateſt mountain of temptation, even the mountain of naturall death it ſelf, if it ſtand in the way, and offer to make a breach in his ſpirituall love from the truth of the Lords merit.</p>
               <p>This ſpirituall darkneſſe, wherein all men are concluded (by the eternall Decree of God) is that door which is ſo ſhut up by God, as no man can open. And this ſpirituall Light (whereby this ſpirituall darkneſſe is enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned) is that key of David (that is, the key of the ſon of David) by which ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall key, the door of the ſpirituall darkneſſe of man, being once opened, all the devils darkneſſe, and all the powers of earth and hell, are not able to ſhut the door again, totally and finally; though by the devils darkneſſe, the regenerate man doth too often ſtumble and fall, and foulely fall.</p>
               <p>Of this concluding of all men (redeemed from the curſe of the eternall darkneſſe) in temporall ſpirituall darkneſſe, (called unbelief and ſin) two fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall points are to be obſerved. The firſt is, the prefigurating of this
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:49359:37"/> ſpirituall darkneſſe, by the darkneſſe of the ſecond Tabernacle. The ſecond is, the Reaſon that this ſpirituall darkneſſe and ſpirituall unbelief, is called ſin by the Apoſtle. This ſpirituall darkneſſe (wherein all men are concluded) was prefigurate by the darkneſſe of the ſecond Tabernacle, which was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Holieſt place, wherein there was no light at all, neither any light to be carried in therein.</p>
               <p>In this Tabernacle, the ark of the Covenant was placed, and in the ark, the word of the two tables of the Law, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9, 3, 4. the pot of Manna, and Aarons rod. Upon the ark was the golden crown, the two cherubims with their wings, covering the Mercy-ſeat, repreſenting the over-ſhadowing power of the three diſtinct perſons of the indiviſible Trinity in the generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the word the bleſſed ſeed, conceived in the womb of the bleſſed Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, afterwards more plainly to be declared: For this covenant was the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of the bleſſed ſeed, firſt made with Adam, and with all men redeemed in Adam the head, ſhut up in temporall darkneſſe; which covenant was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards renued to Abraham, though after a more peculiar manner: For God did promiſe (by his covenant) to Abraham, that the bleſſed ſeed ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend of Abrahams ſeed, and that in Abrahams ſeed, all the nations of the earth ſhould be bleſſed. For this cauſe, the Lord did ſet down to Moſes (de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended of Abrahams ſeed) the patern of the Tabernacle, commanding Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to erect a Tabern<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cle, according to that patern, which was erected; to the end that the Jews, (the poſterity of Abraham) might underſtand, that the promiſe made to Abraham, was really one with the promiſe made to Adam; for as the ſecond tabernacle (called the Holieſt place) did ſignifie the firſt promiſe made to Adam: So the firſt tabernacle (called the Holy place) did prefigurate the fulfilling of the promiſe made to Abraham, which was to be fulfilled, before the ſecond tabernacle could be opened, ſignifying the promiſe made to Adam, which promiſe firſt made to Adam, was fulfilled by the rending of the partition-wall by our Savious death more fully to be declared in the third Book.</p>
               <p>In this ſecond Tabernacle, Aaron the High Prieſt, (as he was the figure of the High Prieſt after the order of Melchiſedeck, the bleſſed ſeed) did enter once ever yeer, arrayed in a white veſture, beſprinckled with the blood of the ſacrifice of the brazen Altar; with a cenſure of coales taken from the brazen altar, kindled with the fire which came down from heaven, and with pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered ſweet incenſe in his hand to be burned upon the coals, when he came into the Holieſt place, that a cloudy ſweet fume might aſcend between the Mercy-ſeat and Aaron. The end of Aarons entring into the Holieſt place once every y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>er, was to obtain pardon for his own actuall ſins, and for the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:49359:37"/> actuall ſins of the congregation; to whom, as he was High Prieſt (and the figure of the High Prieſt after the order of Melchiſedeck) the pardon of actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ſins was given; firſt to himſelf, and in him as he was the High Prieſt to thoſe, whoſe actuall ſins God decreed from all eternity to pardon and forgive.</p>
               <p>Now, though the free grace and mercy of Gods holy Spirit cannot be tied neither to time, place, or perſon, by pardoning of actuall ſin, (for that ſpirituall wind, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.8. bloweth when, and where it liſteth) yet God according to his decree from all eternity, did decree to grant this grace of pardon of actuall ſin at this time to the High Prieſt (in the behalf of the congregation) as he was the figure of the High Prieſt, after the order of Melchiſedeck, for theſe three weighty Reaſons to be preciſely underſtood by all men.</p>
               <p>The firſt was, that all men might know, that the power to pardon actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ſin, is only and immediately in the High Prieſt, after the order of Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſedeck the bleſſed ſeed, as he is God and man, to whom all power in heaven and earth is given by the Trinity. And this was the reaſon, that the Scribes and Phariſees did accuſe our Saviour for ſaying, <hi>Luke</hi> 7.48, 49. <hi>Thy ſins be forgiven thee,</hi> as if our Saviour had ſpoken blaſphemy.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Reaſon is, that the Jews might underſtand that all their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall ſacrifice for ſin, all their ſin-offerings, and all their legall rites and ceremonies of the ceremoniall Law, could not take away their actuall ſins; and that the pardon of actuall ſin is in the only free abſolute power of the High Prieſt, after the order of Melchiſedeck, as he God and man by faith in his only merit.</p>
               <p>The third reaſon is, that all men might underſtand, that the pardon of actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ſin, is by the ſpirituall inlightening of the ſpirituall darkneſſe of man by ſpirituall faith; which was ſignified by the pardon of actuall ſin, which paſt through the cloud of the ſweet incenſe from the Mercy-ſeat to Aaron, as he was High Prieſt, and the figure of the High Prieſt, after the order of Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſedeck; by the ſpirituall light of whoſe holy Spirit, the ſpirituall dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of man is ſpiritually inlightened by ſpirituall faith in his merit, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by all the actuall ſins of the regenerate man are covered and freely pardoned</p>

                  <p n="1">1. The firſt tranſgreſſion of the law by Adam (as he was ſimply obliged to the law of righteouſneſſe) was infinite and mercileſſe, without any revealed mercy. It was infinite, becauſe the tranſgreſſion of the law of righteouſneſſe is the contempt of God, as he is God, and the tranſgreſſion was mercileſſe, becauſe the ſecond Perſon, (in whom is only mercy) was not then revealed to Adam.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The act of the redemption of man from the eternall curſe of the law of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, being performed by man, Chriſt Jeſus, the eternall Son of God, begot man of the ſeed of woman in time; in the juſtice of God, doth equall the eternity of the curſe of the law for the tranſgreſſion of the law of righteouſnes by man.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. All men created in Adam the head, tranſgreſſors of the law in Adam, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to eternall death and darkneſſe, for Adams firſt ſin, are all redeemed from the eternal curſe of the law for that firſt ſin, by the curſed death of Jeſus Chriſt, the eternall Son of God, as he is man begot of the ſeed of the woman. And by the eternall Decree of God, all men in Adam, the redeemed head of man, are conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in originall ſin, and temporall naturall death which followed that ſin.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It is only for actuall ſin (by the tranſgreſſion of the law of righteouſneſſe of faith) for which man is now condemned to the eternall curſe of the law of faith, and that by finall contempt and impenitency, for all men (by the old and new Covenant) have all the dayes of this life to repent them of their actuall ſins.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Fifthly, and conſequently the childe in the wombe, actually and intellectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally informed man, and the ſon of Adam, departing this life, or being borne, and departing this life, before the childe come to actuall morall underſtanding and action, the childe doth depart free from actuall ſinne, and a true Saint in heaven; for the childe is redeemed in Adam the head by the ſacred blood of Chriſt Jeſus the eternall Son of God, begot man of the ſeed of the woman in time, by whoſe pretious blood all men naturally deſcended, and to deſcend of Adam, the redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med head of man, are ſaved from the curſe of the law of the ſinne of Adam.

                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. Though originall ſin doth deſcend upon all men from Adam, the redeemed head of all men; yet Adams actuall ſins doe not deſcend upon his poſterity: For (ſince the fall and redemption of man) the ſoule that ſinneth muſt only dye for the ſin, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.4.

                  <p n="7">7. The doore of the naturall mans ſpirituall darkneſſe, is only and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately opened by the ſpirituall key of David, enlightning the underſtanding of the naturall man, with the grace of ſpirituall faith, in the act of regeneration. While that door therefore ſtandeth open (which all the created powers of God cannot ſhut againe) though the regenerate man doth too too often ſtumble and fall, yet the regenerate man can never fall totally and finally from the grace of ſpirituall faith.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. The free pardon of actuall ſin, is onely and immediately by the free mercy of the Lord Ieſus Chriſt: For by whoſe immediate ſpirituall power, ſpirituall faith is begot; by his onely immediate power actuall ſin is onely pardoned, which power (ſince the power of the high Prieſt is determined) is communicall to all the created powers of God; for this power is the immediate act of the holy Spirit.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Though Adams good workes, (while he ſtood in the ſtate of created perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction) did proceed from his ſpirituall faith, in the promiſe of God the Creator; yet the reward and eternall bleſſing of the word of the firſt ſeventh dayes reſt of the Law of righteouſneſſe, was not due (by the Law) immediately, to Adams faith, but immediately to his workes: But the eternall bleſsing of the word of the ſeventh dayes reſt of the Law of righteouſneſſe of faith is due by the Law, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to the faith of man, and not immediately to the workes of Faith; though by the Law of faith, the workes of faith be as neceſſarily commanded to be produced, according to the formall command of the law, as the faith of man is obliged by covenant, to live the life of righteouſneſſe of faith, as he is inabled by the power of the redeemed word of the law written in his heart: For, as the commanded worſhip of the ſeventh day, is the great command of the Law, (neceſſarily implying the leſſer command) all the workes of faith are neceſſarily commanded, as hath been formerly and neceſſarily demonſtrate. All the workes of man therefore, be they never ſo morally good, according to the literall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the law, are not able to merit the pardon of the leaſt actuall ſin of man,

                  <p n="10">10. Though originall ſin, doth deſcend upon all men redeemed in Adam the redeemed head of man; yet originall ſin is no manner of cauſe of actuall ſin: For firſt, originall ſin is imm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Secondly, actuall ſinne is from the devill, and neither from God, or from the parents: for the generation of man, by man, male and female, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction and bringing forth of man, by man female, (as it is the naturall action of man, the humane intellectuall good creature of God) is a good naturall action, without any actuall ſinne, for it is not the naturall, or the voluntary action of man ſimply that is ſinne; but it is the voluntary action of man, as it is formally morall.

               <head type="sub">Adams arraignment by God for his tranſgreſſion of the Law of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, obliged by the firſt Covenant.</head>
               <p>AS the act of the redemption of man from the curſe of eternall death and darkneſſe, doth concerne the old Covenant, it doth neceſſarily preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the arraignment of our firſt parents, and the cenſure of God for their tranſgreſsion of the Law, which in the infinite mercy of God, is onely tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall in this life: Firſt, therefore of the arraignment of our firſt parents, as it is ſet downe by Moſes, ſo farre briefly thereof, and of the cenſure, as both doe concerne the ſubject in hand. In the araignment of the parties delinquents for the tranſgreſsion of the Law, God doth beginne with the examination of the laſt delinquent; but God doth beginne his cenſure where the ſinne did firſt beginne.</p>
               <p>The laſt delinquent by the tranſgreſsion of the law of righteouſne, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged by the firſt Covenant made by God with man was Adam. God there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (as may appeare, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.9.) doth firſt graciouſly call Adam by his word,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:49359:40"/> who hearing the voyce of God, hid himſelfe (with Eve) amongſt the trees of the garden, flying from the preſence of God, and from his gracious calling by his Word.</p>
               <p>How fearfull is the voyce of God by his Word, calling a ſinner to account for the tranſgeſſion of his Law, as he is a naturall man: For ſo ſoon as Satan doth induce the naturall man to ſin, by the tranſgreſſion of the command of God by his Word, as it is his Law commanding man; Satan doth perſwade the naturall man to flye from the gracious calling of God by his Word; yet God (according to his eternall purpoſe) <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.176. will finde out both Adam and Eve. God there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, doth firſt call Adam, ſaying, <hi>Adam, Where art thou?</hi> as if the Lord had not knowne where Adam was. O infinite mercy of God to man! though man had lately committed high treaſon againſt God; yet God (mercy it ſelfe) doth call Adam by his ſacred Word graciouſly to repentance, Who art thou therefore, that wilt deſpaire of the infinite mercy of God in his Son Chriſt Jeſus, calling thee ſo graciouſly (by his word) to repentance? while Adam, who had commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the greateſt ſin that ever was, or can be committed againſt God by man, was graciouſly called by God.</p>
               <p>Here a Queſtion may be moved: Was not the ſin of our firſt parents (for their firſt tranſgreſſion of the Law) freely pardoned, by the eternall Decree of God, by predeſtinating the only Son of his love, Chriſt Jeſus, as he is man, to the curſed Altar of the Croſſe for that firſt ſin, wherefore then doth God call Adam or Eve to repentance for that firſt ſin?</p>
               <p>I anſwer, firſt, This was more then was knowne to our firſt parents, till the promiſe of the bleſſed ſeed was made. Secondly, all the puniſhments in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted upon our firſt parents for the tranſgreſsion of the Law, are only tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall in this life; and all inflicted by God, to put all men in continuall remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of the infinite love and mercy of God, (in his Son Chriſt Jeſus) for the redemption of man, by the curſed death of his onely Son, as hee is man; without whoſe curſed death, all men muſt have dyed eternally under the fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full curſe of the Law, by eternall death and darkneſſe: and ſo to returne to Adams examination. The words ſet downe by Moſes, are emphaticall, as if they had been ſet downe after this manner: <hi>Adam, Where art thou?</hi> This is ſtrange, that thou ſhouldeſt flye from my preſence, who have dealt ſo graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly with thee; where it may appeare, that God was then converſant with our firſt parents before their fall, even by externall apparition. Adam by his anſwer to Gods calling, (like a naturall man) moſt ungraciouſly (in ſtead of the humble acknowledgement of his horrible fact) doth goe about to ſhift his accuſation for hiding himſelfe, by pretending his ſhame by his nakedneſſe, ſaying, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.10. <hi>I was afraid to come into thy preſence, becauſe I was naked.</hi>
                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:49359:40"/> Naked indeed; both internally, and externally, which is the true effect of ſin. Adam and Eve were both aſhamed of their deformed eſtate, (to which they were brought unto by the baſe foil which they received by believing the Serpent) both were ſenſible of their miſery, but both (as yet) inſenſible of their ſin, which was the cauſe of their miſery; ſuch is the nature of ſin, till the ſinner be ſpiritually called by God. Now, did Adam and Eve begin to feel the evill, which they did ſo long to know, and now was the perfection of our firſt parents underſtanding brought to ſuch a paſſe, as they knew not which way to begin to cover ſo much as their externall nakedneſſe, but were fain to make a poor ſhift, by ſewing of figtree leaves together with ſtrawes, or ſome ſuch like thing, to cover their deformity.</p>
               <p>Here by the way another Queſtion may be moved: What was the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that our firſt parents were ſo carefull to cover their privie parts, more then any other part of their bodies?</p>
               <p>I anſwer briefly, becauſe under the name of Adam, (as Adam is the head of all men, to deſcend of Adam by naturall generation) man, male and fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male is comprehended: For, of Adam, as he is man male ſimply, no man can naturally deſcend of Adam by naturall generation: And therefore it is ſaid, that <hi>God made man, male and female.</hi> Our firſt parents therefore, by this act, in covering of the inſtrumentall parts of generation, do moſt lively expreſſe the ſhame and overthrow of their poſterity by their firſt ſin, which is a main fundamentall point of faith. I return to Adams anſwer.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding of Adams ungracious and unthankfull anſwer to God; yet God will not thus leave Adam. God therefore doth preſſe Adam in theſe words: <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.12. <hi>Who told thee that thou waſt naked?</hi> And to the end that God might move Adam to the confeſſion of the fact, God ſtill preſſeth Adam in theſe words: <hi>Haſt thou eaten of the fruit which I commanded thee that thou ſhouldſt not eat?</hi> By which words, God, (much like a temporall Judge) who (intending to ſave a delinquent, guilty of death by the Law) doth teach the guilty what to ſay for himſelf: For, the Queſtion taken affirmatively, is the confeſſion of the fact.</p>
               <p>By this Queſtion Adam was ſo preſt by God; that Adam (in a manner) doth confeſſe the fact; but it was like the confeſſion of a naturall man, by adding ſin to ſin; for by his confeſſion, moſt ſhamefully and unthankfully, firſt Adam doth charge God, as the cauſe of his foul tranſgreſſion; to wit, becauſe God had given him Eve to wife: Secondly, Adam (for all his love to Eve,) doth charge Eve likewiſe with the cauſe of his tranſgreſſion, hoping (by this means) to excuſe himſelf, and to make Eve ſuffer a dying death for his own foul ambition: where we may obſerve, that when God by his

               <p>Eve fearing the curſe of the Law (by a dying death) to be inflicted both upon her ſelf and Adam (according to the covenant) doth poſt over the cauſe of her tranſgreſſion upon the Serpent, in hope thereby to have freed her ſelf and Adam from the curſe (notwithſtanding of Adams unkinde charging of Eve, for being the cauſe of his own wilfull diſobedience) and to have had the curſe inflicted upon the Serpent, who had ſo maliciouſly betrayed both her and Adam; where it may plainly appear, that (as yet) there was no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe in either of both, for their horrible ſin, notwithſtanding of Gods ſo gracious calling of both by his immediate Word, but God (mercy and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience it ſelf) doth bear patiently with both: For, God (in his eternall purpoſe) did decree, to move both to repentance by another means, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to be declared, when we come to the entring of the ſecond covenant. In the mean time, the judicious Reader may manifeſtly obſerve, that though our firſt parents (by their anſwers to God upon their arraignment) did ſhew themſelves like naturall men, without any manner of ſpirituall underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or action, being ſhut up in ſpirituall darkneſſe, according to the e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>te cauſe of the tranſgreſſion of the Law, was the ſenſitive Serpent. The ſecond was the old murthering Serpent, Satan. The third party was the woman man female, which was betrayed by the Serpent. The fourth and laſt party delinquent, was Adam, man male. Firſt, therefore of the cenſure of God upon the Serpent. The cenſure of the Serpent is ſet down by Moſes after a twofold manner: Firſt, the cenſure is ſet down as it concerns the Serpent in particular: Secondly, the cenſure is ſet down, as the cenſure in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted upon the Serpent doth likewiſe concern the woman, but after a farre differing manner. The cenſure as it doth concern the Serpent in particular is ſet down in theſe words, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.13. <hi>Becauſe thou haſt done this, thou art curſed above all cattle, and above every beaſt of the field: <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon thy belly thou ſhalt go, and duſt ſhalt thou eat all the dayes of thy life.</hi> The cenſure upon the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent hath a literall and myſticall ſenſe. Firſt of the literall ſenſe: By the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terall ſenſe of the cenſure; the ſenſitive Serpent is curſed above all the cattle and beaſts of the field: and firſt the cauſe of the curſe is ſet down, and ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the curſe is pronounced by God, by his Word. The cauſe of the curſe is, becauſe thou haſt done this, that is, becauſe by thy falſe ſuggeſtion, thou haſt betrayed man to fall under the curſe of the Law.</p>
               <p>The curſe of the Law is pronounced by God upon the ſenſitive creature, called the Serpent, without all calling or examination, which of all judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments is the moſt fearfull; while the judgement doth ſo ſuddenly and unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectedly fall without all pre-meditation or prevention: As for the reaſon wherefore God doth thus ſpeak to the Serpent (being an irrationall creature) it will appear by the myſticall ſenſe of the cenſure.</p>
               <p>The curſe upon the Serpent doth divide it ſelf into two branches: The firſt is, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon thy belly ſhalt thou go:</hi> The ſecond is, <hi>Duſt ſhalt thou eat all the dayes of thy life.</hi> Becauſe the literall ſenſe of the cenſure upon the Serpent is
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:49359:43"/> plain, we will only anſwer to a two-fold objection ariſing of the words of the cenſure.</p>
               <p>The firſt whereof is this: The Serpent being a ſenſitive and an irrationall creature, it may be objected, that the Serpent in the juſtice of God, could not be liable to the curſe of the Law; becauſe the irrationall creature cannot be capable to be obliged to the Law of God.</p>
               <p>I anſwer: The Law of God doth ſpare neither the intellectuall ſenſitive, animate, or inanimate creature, if the creature do but come inſtrumentally within the compaſſe of the tranſgreſſion of the Law of God.</p>
               <p>So the brazen Serpent, which was commanded by God (though the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of ſaving ſo many in the Wilderneſſe;) yet, becauſe it was the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumentall cauſe of the people of Iſraels Idolatry, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 18.4. the brazen Serpent was commanded to be broken in pieces.</p>
               <p>So the golden Calf worſhipped by the Iſraelites, was ground to powder; ſome part whereof was caſt down the river; ſome part burned with fire, for being the inſtrumentall cauſe of the people of Iſraels Idolatry; which if all the ſins of man, is moſt fearfull, and moſt diſtaſtefull to God: For, by the ſin of Idolatry, God is neceſſarily denied to be God; which fearfull ſin God doth never leave unpuniſhed at ſome time or other; and ſo much for anſwer to the firſt objection. The ſecond objection is this:</p>
               <p>The curſe of the Creator for the tranſgreſſion of the Law, is the deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the creature, as it is ſuch a creature. Now, before and after the curſe is inflicted upon this ſenſitive creature, (called the Serpent) it is called by Moſes a Serpent. And the nature of the Serpent, being to go, or craul upon the belly, and to eat (at the leaſt) for the moſt part of the duſt of the earth: This cenſure therefore, inflicted by God upon the Serpent, for being the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumentall cauſe of the tranſgreſſion of the Law, could be no curſe at all.</p>
               <p>I anſwer to the objection, and do affirm, that Moſes doth call this ſenſitive creature, a Serpent, from the effect produced therein, by the immediate curſe of the Law of God, pronounced by the power of his Word. And therefore that this ſenſitive creature did walk upon the legs, as other cattle and beaſts of the field, before the curſe was pronounced by God, I thus inforce the point: Firſt, God himſelf (in pronouncing of the curſe) doth call this ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive creature, one of the cattle and beaſts of the field, ſaying, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.13. <hi>Curſed art thou above all the cattle and beaſts of the field:</hi> The ſenſe of the words is this, Thou art the only curſt beaſt of all the number of the cattle and beaſts of the field, amongſt whom thou liveſt. This ſenſitive creature there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore before the curſe, was one of the number of the cattle and beaſts of the field. Secondly, by the power of the curſe, this ſenſitive beaſt is neceſſitate
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:49359:43"/> to go upon the belly, and craul. This ſenſitive beaſt therefore, (called the Serpent) before it was curſed by the power of the Word, did not go and craul upon the belly, but did walk upon the legs, as other ſenſitive cattle and beaſts of the field. Thirdly, this ſenſitive creature, (called the Serpent) by the power of the curſe, is neceſſitate by crauling upon the belly, to eat and feed upon the duſt of the earth. This ſenſitive creature therefore, before the curſe, did not live by licking up of the duſt of the earth, but by walking, as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cattle, did feed upon the herbs and graſſe of the field. Fourthly, it is ſaid, that this ſenſitive creature (called the Serpent) was, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.1. <hi>more ſubtill then any beaſt of the field,</hi> that is, in ſenſitive apprehenſion. This ſenſitive beaſt therefore, according to the ſubtilty of ſenſitive apprehenſion, above all other cattle and beaſts of the field, was created with an organicall ſenſitive body, anſwerable to diſcharge the internall ſenſitive perfection, equall (if not above) the externall ſhape and form of other cattle and beaſts of the field. Fifthly, the enmity inflicted by the cenſure, between the Serpent and its ſeed, and the woman and her ſeed, doth neceſſarily preſuppoſe a former amity and love between man and this ſenſitive creature: For, as this ſenſitive crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was of a more nimble and ſenſitive apprehenſion, above all the other cattle and beaſts of the field: So it was next to man in ſenſitive apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and therfore more converſant with man, then any of the other ſenſitive creatures; and in all probability, did wait, as it were, upon Eve, and therefore the more fit inſtrument for Satan to work his miſchief. Sixthly by the myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call ſenſe of this curſe upon the ſenſitive creature called the Serpent (wherby it is caſt down from walking upon the legs, to craul upon the belly) the old murdering Serpent Satan, is ſo caſt down upon the belly of his great power (for the betraying of man) as he ſhall never betray all men again with ſuch a high hand, at one clap, as he did before, more plainly to be declared in the next Chapter. Seventhly, by the fearfull ſudden unexpected judgement pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced by God in his fierce wrath, as a terrible Judge upon this ſenſitive creature, in the preſence of our firſt parents, (amazed at the terror of the curſe, and fearing no leſſe, then their turn next, to have the curſe of the Law actually inflicted upon them) ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> firſt parents were moved to repentance, and prepared for the imbracing of the gracious promiſe of the bleſſed ſeed, which was preſently after made by God, whereby the ſecond covenant was entred between God and man. Laſtly, to conclude this point; either there muſt be a ſupernaturall ſenſitive mutation in this ſenſitive creature, by the curſe of the Law (as it was ſuch a creature, though tranſcendent to all Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophicall reaſon) whereby this ſenſitive creature was caſt down from walking upon the legs, and from eating of the herbs of the field, to craul upon
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:49359:44"/> the ground, and to eat and feed upon the duſt of the earth: or, the plain words of the Scripture muſt be contradicted. And ſo much for the literall ſenſe of the cenſure of God by the curſe of the Law, as the cenſure doth concern the Serpent in particular: Next of the myſticall ſenſe of the cenſure.</p>

From the great power of Satans ſting, whereby he did ſting all men to eternall death from the beginning, Satan, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 27.1. is called a Dragon: Satan, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.2. is called the great Leviathan, which devoureth ſo many fiſhes at one mouthfull: Satan from his ſtinging of all men from the beginning, is called the Murderer of mankinde: From his continuall ſtinging of man to make them fall by finall impenitency under the mercileſſe curſe of the Law of Faith <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.44. Satan is likewiſe called a Murderer: <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.9. Satan is called the Devill, becauſe Satan having ſtung man (by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing man to commit ſin upon ſin) Satan doth object to wretched man, the ſeverity of Gods juſtice, continually accuſing man for his ſins againſt God; and the impoſſibility of Gods mercy to the multitude of his ſins; whereby wretched man, without Gods preventing mercy, in his Son Chriſt Jeſus, is ſtung with the ſting of deſpair. Satan for his ſtinging of all men by his firſt blaſphemous lie againſt God, whereby he betrayed all men, is called, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.44. <hi>the father of lies:</hi> For lying is the firſt ſeed that he ſowes amongſt men, even in a manner, from the cradle: From the great power of the falſe light, wherewith he baits his ſting to deceive man, Satan is called, <hi>the Prince of darkneſſe,</hi> becauſe by the power of his great falſe light, the literall light of the word of the Law, and life of righteouſneſſe written in the heart of man, is obſcured and darkned; and in this ſenſe, Satan is likewiſe called, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.4. God of the earth, from the multitude of his followers.</p>
               <p>As the cauſe of the curſe is firſt ſet down, and then the curſe of the Law is literally pronounced upon the ſenſitive Serpent: So the cauſe is firſt myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally ſet down to Satan, and then the curſe is pronounced upon the old Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:49359:44"/> Satan. The cauſe is ſet down in theſe words; <hi>becauſe thou haſt done this;</hi> The myſticall ſenſe of the words is this: Satan, becauſe thou haſt done this, (that is) becauſe thou haſt been the firſt cauſe and author of this miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, (to wit) not only of the condemnation of Adam, and of all men natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally to deſcend of Adam, to eternall death and darkneſſe, by the curſe of the Law of righteouſneſſe, but becauſe thou art likewiſe the cauſe of the curſed death of Chriſt Jeſus, the eternall Son of God, as he is man, in redeeming of man from the eternall curſe of the Law; curſed therefore art thou, above all the intellectuall creatures of God, as thy inſtrument the Serpent is curſed above all the cattle and beaſts of the field, becauſe thou haſt done this. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the two branches of the curſe, literally inflicted upon the ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Serpent: The two branches are myſtically inflicted upon Satan in the Serpent: The firſt is,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon thy belly thou ſhalt goe.</hi> Myſtically Satan muſt go upon his belly: the myſticall ſenſe of the words is this: Satan, thou art caſt down upon the belly of thy great power, whereby thou didſt ſo maliciouſly betray and deceive the firſt Adam, and all men created in Adam the head; ſo that thou ſhalt never riſe again, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.10. (with ſuch a high hand of power) to deceive and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray the ſecond Adam (to wit) Chriſt Jeſus, and his myſticall members. This myſticall ſenſe of the firſt branch of the curſe, inflicted upon Satan, is ſet down by the Apoſtle Jude, <hi>chap.</hi> 6. to be the eternall chains of darkneſſe, to which Satan (ever ſince) is chained, like a Bear to the ſtake; the compaſſe of which chain Satan muſt not paſſe over, neither do within the compaſſe of that chain, but what Satan is permitted by God: For, though Satan was caſt down from the heavens like lightning, <hi>Luke</hi> 10.18. by the curſe of the Angelicall obligement of the Law which he did tranſgreſſe: For, Satan ſinned, Satan therefore tranſgreſſed the Law, whereby he was Angelically obliged. Yet Satans power was wonderfull, untill he brought himſelf within the compaſſe of the curſe of the humane obligement of the Law, by his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traying of innocent man, which is now pronounced by God upon Satan, whereby Satans high power is curbed, and himſelf confined and chained till the great day; when Satan ſhal receive his final judgement, and be caſt down in the eternall burning lake, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.10. for his malicious betraying of man: Who, as he did firſt betray the woman man female, ſo by man (the ſeed of the woman) he ſhall be condemned in the great day (to wit) by man, Chriſt Jeſus, and his myſticall members, who is the myſticall man, which muſt break the head of the great Serpent, in the great day, to his eternall confuſion. And this is the reaſon that Satan did ſo ſaucily challenge our Saviour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 8.29. for tormenting of him before his time. Becauſe our Saviour croſſed Satan,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:49359:45"/> by diſpoſſeſſing of the man poſſeſſed with Satans malicious ſpirit.</p>
               <p>The ſecond branch of the curſe literally inflicted upon the ſenſitive Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, as the literall curſe doth concern the Serpent in particular, is myſtical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inflicted upon the old Serpent Satan, in theſe words: <hi>Duſt ſhalt thou eat all the dayes of thy life:</hi> By the myſticall ſenſe of this branch of the curſe; Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan is neceſſitate to feed upon the duſt of the earth: By the duſt of the earth, the foul duſty ſtinking ſins of man ſince the fall, is myſtically ſignified; which Satan muſt lick up and feed upon, <hi>Mich.</hi> 7.17. or Satan muſt ſtarve himſelf with his malice, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.28. Satans hunger and thirſt therefore, to make wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched man ſin, is one of the chief cauſes that Satan goeth about continually <hi>(like a roaring Lion)</hi> 1 Pet. 5.8. <hi>ſeeking whom he may devoure:</hi> for Satan is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitate by the curſe, to feed upon the ſins of man, whoſe inſatiable hunger and thirſt, (by reaſon of the neceſſity of this curſe) is never ſatisfied. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cauſe of Satans continuall going about, <hi>ſeeking whom he may devoure,</hi> is Satans fear, leſt too many ſhould be regenerate, and become myſticall mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the myſticall man, and become Satans heavie judges in the great day: For, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt united to his myſticall members, is the myſticall man, by whom Satants head, and the head of his curſed ſeed, in the great day, muſt be finally and eternally broke, to their eternall confuſion. And ſo much of the cenſure of God, as it doth concern the ſenſitive Serpent, and myſtically the old Serpent Satan.

               <p>THe cenſure of God upon the Serpent, as it doth concern the woman, is ſet down by Moſes in theſe words, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. <hi>I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy ſeed and her ſeed; it ſhall break thy head, and thou ſhalt bruiſe his heel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This cenſure hath likewiſe a literall and myſticall ſenſe, and doth divide it ſelf into three branches: The firſt is, <hi>I will put enmity between thee and the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and between thy ſeed and her ſeed:</hi> The ſecond is, <hi>It ſhall break thy head:</hi> The third is, <hi>Thou ſhalt bruiſe his heel.</hi>

               <p>In the three branches of this cenſure, (as the cenſure doth concern the woman and her ſeed) doth conſiſt the foundation of all Chriſtian faith from the firſt promiſe of the bleſſed ſeed made to Adam: For, in the ſecond branch of this cenſure, the ſecond covenant is made by God with man, in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of the bleſſed ſeed.</p>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:49359:45"/>
               <p>The Declaration therefore of this cenſure (as it doth concern the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and the woman) ſhall be diſcharged in theſe two points: Firſt, the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terall and myſticall ſenſe of the three branches of the cenſure ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared. Secondly, the ſecond covenant in the promiſe of the bleſſed ſeed, ſhall be ſet down: After the declaration of which two points, the cenſure of God upon the two laſt parties, delinquents, ſhall be followed, according to the order ſet down by Moſes. Firſt, therefore of the literall ſenſe of the thee branches of the cenſure; and next of the myſtall ſenſe: By the literall ſenſe of the firſt branch of the cenſure, a naturall enmity and hatred is put be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Serpent &amp; the woman, who were formerly ſo loving and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant one with another, which enmity and hatred, is put likewiſe between the ſeed of both. By reaſon of this enmity and hatred, mortall, bloody, irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concileable wars are ſtirred up between the parties. This was a miſerable cenſure inflicted upon the Serpent, not only to be caſt down by the curſe from the former eſtate, to craul ſo deſpicably and loathſomely upon the belly, and to eat the duſt of the earth, but likewiſe to be ſo neceſſitate, (by the curſe) to ſuch a baſe condition, as neither man or woman can abide the Serpent, who were formerly ſo loving and familiar one with another; which hatred (according to the eternall Decree of God) muſt continue till the worlds end. This hatred is not only a ſimple privation of the former love between this ſenſitive creature and man, but it is a poſitive enmity, accompanied with ſuch a neceſſitate fear of man in the Serpent, as if the fire ſtand in the way (while man doth purſue the Serpent,) the Serpent (to flie the preſence of man) will craul thorow the fire it ſelf. Though this enmity be inflicted upon the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and its ſeed as a curſe; yet it is no wayes inflicted as a curſe upon the woman, or upon her ſeed, but doth naturally proceed from both to the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, for the Serpents betraying of man, to fall under the eternall curſe of the Law; for whoſe redemption, the ſacred blood of Chriſt Jeſus (as he is man) was ſo truly and neceſſarily ſhed, though it be no ſmall cut to man, while man (at whoſe frown, the moſt cruell Lion did moſt ſubmiſſively ſtoop) muſt now be afraid of the ſting of ſuch a baſe crauling creature as the Serpent.</p>
               <p>The ſecond branch of the cenſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e is, <hi>It ſhall break thine head:</hi> whereby the word <hi>[it]</hi> is to be underſtood, man the ſeed of the woman, as ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by the myſticall ſenſe of the cenſure. By the eternall Decree of God therefore, the ſeed of the woman muſt break the head of the Serpent, which is the moſt miſerable curſe of all to the Serpent: For the head (implying the brain) which is the originall of the ſenſitive powers of the ſenſitive creature, being broke and bruiſed (as it were) in pieces, both the ſenſitive and vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative life of the Serpent, is extinguiſhed in the originall, and conſequently
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:49359:46"/> the venemous power of the ſting of the Serpent, bruiſed and broken. And by whom? By man the ſeed of the woman, and why? becauſe thou haſt done this. The victory therefore of this irreconcileable wars, is (by the eternall Decree of God) decreed to man, the ſeed of the woman. But though the victory of this bloody irreconcileable wars, be decreed to the ſeed of the woman; yet the conqueſt is not without ſome fear and danger, to wit, <hi>Thou ſhalt bruiſe his heel;</hi> that is, the heel of man, the ſeed of the woman. By the heel, the loweſt part of man, as he is ſenſitive, is to be underſtood: for nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Serpent, or Satan, or any created power, muſt enter the ſoul of man, to ſting man, as he is a ſpirituall man. The Serpent therefore by its ſting, muſt bruiſe the naturall man, as he is ſenſitive, and not as the man is intellectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and a ſpirituall man.

               <p>BY the myſticall ſenſe of the firſt branch of this cenſure; the enmity put between the ſenſitive Serpent and the woman, is myſtically put between the old murdering Serpent, and the Church of God, which is the body of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the head of the Church, myſtically ſignified by the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; For, this myſticall woman is the bleſſed Virgine. By the ſeed of the Serpent, is myſtically ſignified, thoſe whom Satan by the ſowing of his ſeed of enmity (even in a manner from the cradle) doth beget to be haters of
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:49359:46"/> the truth of the word, and perſecutors of the Profeſſors of the Word, are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the children and ſeed of Satan. By this myſticall woman, therefore, to wit, the bleſſed Virgine, the redeemed militant Church of God upon earth, is myſtically to be underſtood: By the ſeed of the woman, firſt Chriſt Jeſus the Word: ſecondly the children begot of the Word, brought forth by the Church, are myſtically ſignified. Firſt, thoſe who (by the preaching of the Word) are morally begotten, by moral faith: And ſecondly, thoſe whom God, according to his eternall purpoſe, doth ſpiritually enlighten by the grace of ſpirituall faith; who by their morall and ſpirituall love, are morally and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually united to their immediate head, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the Word and Truth; and by that morall and ſpirituall union, members of his body, which is the militant Church of God upon earth. Though this enmity and hatred be inflicted upon Satan and his curſed ſeed, as a curſe (whereby they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to hate the truth, and to perſecute the poſſeſſed of the truth;) yet this enmity is not inflicted upon the Church, and upon the ſeed of the Church as a curſe: For the Church of God, as they are members of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, in whom they live, move, and have their being, they do hate all the profeſſors of his truth, who are the Church of God. By this enmity therefore, put be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween theſe parties, irreconcileable mortall and bloody wars, is raiſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Satan and his ſeed, and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the Word of truth, and his members the Church, begot of the ſeed of the Word. And from this irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concileable bloody wars, the Church of God upon earth, is ſaid to be the militant Church. This enmity and hatred, to which Satan (by the curſe) is neceſſitate; is not only a ſimple privation of the former love and amity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and Satan, for Satan (as hath been formerly declared) was crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a moſt glorious Angel, in the high love and favour of God, untill ſuch time as Satan (for his foul ambitious ſin) was caſt down into a moſt deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable and diſgracefull manner from the heavens, and from his converſment with the bleſſed Angels, who are miniſtring ſpirits ſent out by God, for the ſafety of his Chu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ch upon earth, againſt the power of Satan, and of his ſeed; and therefore the eternall bleſſing of the Word of the Lords Evangelicall ſeventh dayes reſt, is extended to the bleſſed Angels, (according to the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Decree of God;) by the immediate power of which bleſſing, the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Angels do ſtand in their created perfection. Satan therefore, (by this enmity) is not only deprived of his former love to God, and to his truth, but likewiſe Satan, for his betraying of man by his belying of the truth, Satan is neceſſitate by a poſitive enmity and hatred, to hate the truth, and to perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the Profeſſors of the truth; and ſo are his curſed brood, whom Satan by the ſowing of his ſeed, begets to be bloody finall perſecutors of the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:49359:47"/> Church. Here two Queſtions may be moved; the firſt is this: Are all thoſe the curſed ſeed of Satan, who are called the children and ſeed of Satan?</p>
               <p>I anſwer: The ſeed of Satan is taken in a two-fold ſenſe: Firſt, all men, who are actually ſinners, (as they do ſin actually) are called the children and ſeed of Satan; for actuall ſin is from the Devill, and of theſe many (being ſtung by Satans ſting of enmity, ſweetned by his falſe deceiving light) are ſtirred up to be perſecutors of the Church for a time; though afterwards they become pillars of the Church; and ſuch a perſecutor was Paul before his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall darkneſſe was ſpiritually enlightned by ſpirituall faith.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the ſeed of Satan is taken for thoſe whom Satan (by his bewit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching ſting of enmity, ſweetned by his falſe pleaſing deceiving darkneſſe) hath induced to ſuch a finall hatred of all truth, and of all profeſſors of the truth, provoking the long patience of God, (leading them ſo graciouſly to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance) till for their finall contempt and impenitency, God in his juſtice doth juſtly give them over to a reprobate mind, whereby they do inherit the curſe of their father Satan; and theſe are the only curſed ſeed of Satan.</p>
               <p>The parties therefore of this irreconcileable mortall bloody wars, is firſt Satan, and not only his curſed ſeed, but likewiſe all thoſe whom (by his falſe deceiving light) Satan hath ſtirred up for a time, to be haters of the truth, and perſecutors of the profeſſors of the truth, who are the Church of God. The other party of this irreconcileable war, is the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the Word, and the ſeed of the Church, of which ſacred ſeed the morall and myſticall members of his body are begot, who out of their love to their head, (Truth it ſelf) do neceſſarily and mortally hate all haters of his truth, and all perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors of the profeſſors of his truth.</p>
               <p>The ſecond queſtion may be moved; what is the reaſon that this irrecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileable enmity and hatred, is put by the Lord, between the parties, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by his Church is ſo continually and ſo bloodily perſecuted and afflicted in this life, by Satan and his ſeed; ſince the Church is more dear to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt then his own life, (as he is man) was to himſelf?</p>
               <p>I anſwer: The reaſon is, firſt, that the Lord Jeſus Chriſt may be glorified by the redeemed valour of his militant Church, in his continuall preſervation thereof, againſt the mighty power of Satan and his ſeed; that the world may know, that all their labour is in vain. Secondly, that his myſticall mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers (in their myſticall head) may victoriouſly revenge the blood of man up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Satan and his curſed ſeed in the great day, by the finall breaking of their head, to their eternall confuſion. Thirdly, that in recompence of their valour (for their couragious defending of the truth in this life) they may be crowned with an incorruptible crown of glory in their myſticall head in the life to
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:49359:47"/> come: For by the eternall Decree of God, the victory of this irreconcileable war is decreed to the myſticall man, Chriſt Jeſus and his myſticall members. The ſeed of the woman muſt break the head of the Serpent, according to the ſecond branch of the cenſure, the myſticall ſenſe whereof is next to be declared.</p>

               <head type="sub">The myſticall ſenſe of the ſecond branch of the cenſure.</head>
               <p>BY the myſticall ſenſe of this ſecond branch of the cenſure, the victory of this irreconcileable war, is decreed to the ſeed of the woman: For, as by the falſe ſuggeſtion of Satan, the woman was firſt deceived by the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent; ſo by the eternall Decree of God, the head of the old murdering Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent Satan, and the head of his curſed ſeed, ſhall be broke by the ſeed of the woman. The myſticall woman therefore, in this branch of the cenſure, is the bleſſed Virgine; and the myſticall ſeed of the Virgine, is the Word, who is promiſed to become man of the ſeed of the woman, by whom the head of the Serpent muſt be broke. In this ſecond branch therefore of the cenſure, the ſacred generation, conception, birth, death, and reſurrection, of the Word, as he is man of the ſeed of the woman, is neceſſarily and myſtically implied, which is the meaning and ſenſe of the promiſe of the bleſſed ſeed, myſtically ſet down in this ſecond branch of the cenſure. For the better conceiving of this ſacred myſtery; firſt the naturall generation of man is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily to be conſidered. The naturall generation of man, is performed, firſt by the mutuall concourſe of man, male and female, in the act of genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whereby the naturall ſeed of man male, is received and united to the naturall ſeed of man female in the womb; by the innate vertue and callidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty whereof, the maſculine and feminine potentiall vertue of the united ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſeed is produced in act in the matter of the ſeed, and actually and ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively conceived and formed. And this is the firſt conception of woman, which is the ſeminall and ſenſitive conception of man.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the formed ſenſitive body (fed and nurſed by the pure blood of the woman) being brought to ſuch ſenſitive perfection, as the high elaborate vitall ſpirits of the heart, doth appetite the intellectuall form; the intellectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ſoul humane ſpirit, is eſſentially united to the vitall ſpirits of the heart of the Infant in the womb, by the eternall Father of ſpirits, according to his covenant; by which immediate eſſentiall union, the Infant (in the womb) is man, and ſo conceived man by woman. And this is the ſecond concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of woman, whereby man, as he is man, is conceived in the womb, and
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:49359:48"/> in the prefixed time of naturall birth, brough forth man, by man female the woman, without the naturall ſeed, therefore of man male it is impoſſible that man can be, either begot, conceived, or brought forth man by naturalll generation.</p>
               <p>To return therefore to this ſacred myſterie of the generation and concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the word, (the promiſed bleſſed ſeed) to be made fleſh of the ſeed of the woman, by whom the Serpents head is to be broke; which is myſtically ſet down in the ſecond branch of this cenſure. Firſt, by the word <hi>[It]</hi> in this branch of the cenſure, the only naturall ſeed of the Virgin, is myſtically ſignified. Secondly, by this word <hi>[It]</hi> all naturall ſeed of man male, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from this ſacred generation; and conſequently, the ſacred overſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowing power of the moſt High, is neceſſarily implied: By which ſacred overſhadowing act, the potentiall maſculine vertue was communicate and united to the potentiall vertue of the feminine ſeed in the womb of the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, and by the innate naturall power and callidity of the womb, the united potentiall maſculine and feminine vertue was produced in act in the matter of the Virgins ſeed; of which ſanctified ſeed, that holy thing was conceived, and actually and ſenſitively formed. Thirdly, this holy thing ſo formed, was fed, nurſed, and cheriſhed by the pure naturall blood of the Virgine in the womb, which being brought to ſuch ſenſitive perfection, as the elabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate vitall ſpirits of the heart of the holy thing, did appetet the intellectuall form: The true ſpirit of man (begot by the Father of ſpirits) eſſentially uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the divine nature, was indiviſibly and eſſentially united to the vitall ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of the heart of the holy ſenſitive thing: and by the indiviſible power of the Trinity, eſſentially anointed with the ſpirituall oil of gladneſſe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.9. and ſo conceived by the ſecond conception of the Virgine, and (in the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of time) brought forth the firſt born Son of the bleſſed Virgine, and the naturall Son of the moſt High, the word and the ſeed of the Church. And thus was the Word made fleſh of the ſeed of the woman, which was moſt lively prefigurate by the ark of the covenant placed in the inner Tabernacle, which was the covenant of the bleſſed ſeed, whereby God did covenant with Adam, (and with all naturall men condemned in Adam the head) that the Word ſhould be born man, of the ſeed of the woman, by whoſe curſed death, Adam, and all men condemned in Adam, ſhould be redeemed from the eternall curſe of the Law for that firſt ſin, which was prefigurate to the poſterity by the Ark of the covenant.</p>
               <p>Firſt, by the Ark, the bleſſed Virgine was prefigurate: by the capacity of the Ark, the Virgines womb was ſignified: By the word of the two tables of the Teſtimony, the Word conceived in the Virgines womb was ſignified:
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:49359:48"/> By the Pot of Manna, the eternall life of the Word; and by Aarons Rod, his infinite power, which were placed ſeverally by the Word in the Ark; ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the eſſentiall union of the divine nature, to the humane nature of the Word in the womb of the Virgin: By the two Cherubims (with their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtretched wings overſhadowing the Mercy-ſeat,) the overſhadowing act of the indiviſible power of the Trinity in the ſacred generation of the Word of the ſeed of the Virgin, was moſt lively repreſented: For, by the two cherubims, the diſtinct perſons of the Father and holy Spirit; and by the Mercy-ſeat the ſecond perſon of the Trinity (Mercy it ſelf) is ſignified. By which ſacred overſhadowing act of the indiviſible power of the Trinity, as the Word was firſt begot man ſenſitively of the ſeed of the Virgine; ſo the Word was ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitively conceived by the Virgines firſt conception; and as the Word (being brought to ſenſitive perfection in the womb) by the immediate act of the Father of ſpirits, (which is the indiviſible act of the Trinity) the holy thing was begot man, eſſentially united to the divine nature: So was the Word conceived by the ſecond conception of the Virgine; and in the fulneſſe of time brought forth, <hi>Mat.</hi> 1.25. the firſt born Son of the Virgin, and the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Son of the moſt High; and therefore that holy thing is called the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Son of God: For, though the ſacred generation of the Word of the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male ſeed of the Virgine was ſupernaturall; yet the twofold conception of the Word by the Virgine, the maintaining of the childe by her pure blood, and the bringing forth of the Word ſo made man of the ſeed of the Virgine, was the naturall act of the Virgine; and therefore the Word made fleſh of the ſeed of the woman true man eſſentially united to the divine nature; and therefore it is ſaid, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 2.9. that <hi>in him the Godhead dwelleth bodily.</hi> Of this gracious promiſe of the bleſſed ſeed thus prefigurate by the Ark, three main fundamentall points are to be preciſely obſerved: Firſt, the pot of Manna, and Aarons Rod, placed ſeverally by the Word of the two Tables of the Law in the Ark, prefigurating the eſſentiall union of the divine nature, to the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature of the Word, was to ſignifie to all men, that though the divine and humane nature of the Word were eſſentially and indiviſibly united; yet, that this eſſentiall union is without any confounding of the two natures, or of their eſſentiall attributes. And therefore, though we may truly ſay, that the Word is God and man; yet we cannot ſay, that the Word is man, as he is God: or, that he is God, as he is man; neither muſt we attribute the eſſential proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the divine nature to the human nature of the word, or the eſſential attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes of the human nature to the divine nature of the word. The ſecond point to be obſerved, is the reaſon that the Church of God is myſtically ſignified by the woman; the reaſon whereof is the twofold naturall conception of the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:49359:49"/> woman, which is (as it were) the embleme of the twofold conception of the morall and myſticall members of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, which are brought forth by the Church: For, as the morall conception of the naturall man by morall faith, (by the preaching and ſowing of the ſeed of the Word) doth reſemble the ſeminall and firſt conception of the woman: So doth the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall conception of the regenerate man by the Church, reſemble the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond conception of woman: For, though the regenerate man be ſpiritually enlightned by the immediate light of the holy Spirit; yet that ſpirituall light is the ſpirituall light of the Word, which is the ſeed of the Church, and the regenerate man is enlightned thereby, as he is a member of the Church, which is the body of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. The third main fundamentall point to be obſerved in this gracious promiſe, is the immediate cauſe of the Lords love to his militant Church: For, the immediate ſole efficient cauſe of his love to the Church, is, the eſſentiall union of this divine and humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Word: As the immediate cauſe of this eſſentiall union, is the Lords infinite love to all men eternally condemned to the curſe of eternall death for the ſin of Adam. Whence the infinit joy and gladneſſe of the ſacred Trinity did ariſe to reſt eternally upon the eſſential union, of which eſſentiall union and unction, doth ariſe the Lords love to his Church, by his ſacred Word, as his Word (by his love) is the Image of this eſſentiall union: For, as by the literall light of his Word of the ſeventh dayes reſt of the Law of righteouſneſſe of faith, (proceeding from his love, which is of one reall light with the redeemed word in the heart of man) the naturall man is morally led to the Lords merit: So by the Spirituall light of the Word, proceeding from his ſpirituall love, (which is the ſpirituall light of his holy Spirit) the regenerate man is ſpiritually led to the Lords merit, and ſpiritually, myſtical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and indiviſibly united to his myſticall head: For, by this ſpirituall love, all the regenerate are coupled and united joynt to joynt, one to another; and all indiviſibly to their myſticall head, whence the ſpirituall joy and glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the regenerate doth ariſe, which is called the joy of the Holy Ghoſt; for this ſpirituall union and unction is really one in the head and members; but it is eſſentiall in the head, and ſpirituall in the members, ſpiritually flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the eſſentiall union and unction of the head: and this is the reaſon that it is ſaid by the Prophet David, prophecying of this union and unction, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45.7. <hi>Thou haſt anointed him with the oil of gladneſſe above his fellowes:</hi> Whoſe fellows, are his myſticall brethren, begotten of the ſame Father; for both the head and the members are the ſons of God, the head eſſentially; and therefore the naturall Son of God; the members ſpiritually, and therefore the ſpirituall and adopted ſons of God in their myſticall head; who are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:49359:49"/> predeſtinate, to be made like to his Image, that he might be the firſt born Son amongſt many brethren. And in this ſenſe our Saviour is called, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.7. <hi>The fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſt born Son</hi> of the Virgine, the woman, in reſpect of his myſticall mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, who are begot of the woman, the Church. Though the ſpirituall joy therefore of the regenerate, doth many times ebbe and flow; yet the ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all love, whereby they are ſpiritually united to their myſticall head (whence this ſpirituall joy doth ariſe) is indiviſible in the head and members: It is as impoſſible therefore, for the regenerate, to fall totally and finally from the grace of their ſpirituall love (whereby they are indiviſibly united to their myſticall head;) As for the humane nature of the word, to fall from the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine nature, and alone: For the eſſentiall union of the divine and humane nature of the Word, is the ſole immediate efficient cauſe of this indiviſible union, and muſt mutually ſtand together.</p>
               <p>By this ſpirituall union and unction (whereby the regenerate are indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly united to the truth of the Lords merit) the regenerate man is ſo armed with the ſpirituall valour of patience, as he is enabled to reſiſt the ſtrongeſt temptation of the Devill, and of his powerfull inſtruments, and to ſtand to the Lords truth, even the loſſe of his naturall life; by which ſpirituall valour, the regenerate man doth overcome the power of Satan, and of all his cruell crue in this life: For, this ſpirituall valour doth proceed from the decreed victory of this irreconcileable bloody war to the ſeed of the woman: For the ſeed of the woman muſt break the head of the Serpent, and the head of the Serpents ſeed; though the victory be not without temporall danger and afflictions, as may appear by the myſticall ſenſe of the third branch of the cenſure, next to be declared.</p>

               <p>SAtan and his curſed bloody brood, (by the myſticall ſenſe of the firſt branch of the cenſure) being neceſſitate to hate the truth, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of the truth, (who are the Church of God) and to induce all others (to his power) to hate and perſecute the Church: Satan, firſt (by the myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call ſenſe of this third branch of the cenſure) is limited how far his power ſhall extend, myſtically ſignified by the word, <hi>Heel,</hi> which is the loweſt part of man, as he is man intellectuall and ſenſitive, whereby the ſenſitive power of man (as he is man) is ſignified.</p>
               <p>Satan therefore, (by his curſed ſting of enmity) hath the power to ſting and bite man, as he is a naturall man, intellectuall and ſenſitive; but no wayes
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:49359:50"/> as he is a ſpirituall man: For Satan, with all his power, cannot ſting the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate man, not ſo much as to induce him to commit the leaſt actuall ſin: For the regenerate man is born of God, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.9. and cannot ſin, as he is a ſpirituall man. And therefore the Apoſtle Paul, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.17, 18. doth diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim his actuall ſins to be his, (to wit) as he is a ſpirituall and a regenerate man; but doth attribute his actuall ſins to his rebellious fleſh, as he is a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall man, and the old man corrupted by Satan, and his wicked inſtruments, even in a manner, from the cradle.</p>
               <p>Secondly, by the myſticall ſenſe of this word <hi>[His]</hi> Satan, and his curſed brood, (according to the eternall Decree of God) is permitted: firſt, to ſting the Word (the bleſſed ſeed, made fleſh of the ſeed of the woman) whom that old murdering blood-hound, and his curſed bloody brood did ſting moſt cruelly, to the curſed death of the croſſe. Secondly, by the word <hi>[His]</hi> Satan and his ſeed, is permitted to ſting and bite the heel of the Lords myſticall members, who are predeſtinate to be made like to the Image of their myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call head, that they may taſte of the cup of his afflictions in this life (which our Saviour hath drunk of, charged up to the brim for the ſins of man) to the end, that his myſticall members may feel the ſorrows and afflictions which he did ſuſtain for man; and that they may teſtifie their redeemed ſpirituall valour, by their maintaining of his truth in this life, in recompence where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, an incorruptible crown of glory is laid up for them in the life to come. By this, the permiſſive decreed power to Satan and his ſeed, the Church of God hath been continually ſtung and afflicted, ever ſince the promiſe of the bleſſed ſeed was made to man. How ſoon did that murdering Dragon ſtir up Cain to murder his innocent brother Abel; and what fearfull effects did follow that murder, while of Cains wicked race, the world was ſet in ſuch a fire of all ſin, cruelty and uncleanneſſe, as the whole world was brought to the number of eight perſons? And ſo hath this bloody Hell-hound and his wicked ſeed, continued ever ſince, by ſtinging the Prophets and Saints of God, before Chriſt, and ſince, his Apoſtles and Martyrs in all ages. And was there ever greater ſtinging and bloody perſecutions of the truth, and of the profeſſors of the truth, then there is in this miſerable age?</p>
               <p>The regenerate man therefore (while he is in this life,) muſt reſolve to march under the white and bloody colours of the immaculate Lamb, and to ſtand to the defence of the purity of the truth of his myſticall head; fight he muſt, for Satan the great Dragon, and his bloody brood, are naturally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to bite and ſting. The regenerate man therefore muſt reſolve himſelf both to give, and many times to take the foil. And though Satan and his wicked crue, (by byting of his heel) do make him trip, ſtumble, and fall; yet

And though in the conflict the regenerate man be ſtung to naturall death; yet the prize is his own: For (according to the eternall decree of God) he muſt riſe again, and in his myſticall head revenge the blood of man upon Satan and his curſed feed, by breaking of their heads to their eternall confuſion; and in recompence of their valour in this life, be crowned with an incorruptible crown of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in his myſticall head, in the life to come: For, by the eternall Decree of God, the ſeed of the woman muſt break the head of the Serpent. What I ſay to the regenerate man, I ſay likewiſe to the naturall man, whom God in his mercy hath preſerved from Satans overcomming, to be his curſed ſeed; and whom God, (in his eternall purpoſe) hath decreed in his prefixed time to call ſpiritually, for both are commanded to reſiſt Satan: For if the naturall man (out of the power of his redeemed morall grace) doth but reſiſt Satan twice or thrice: Satan, <hi>Jam</hi> 4.7. like a coward, will turn tail, and flie away, as the ſenſitive Serpent, from the preſence of man. Let the regenerate and and the good naturall man therefore look up continually to the crown that that is laid up for them, and withall remember that he that doth deny the Lords truth totally and finally in this life, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.33. the Lord will deny him before his Father in the great day.</p>
               <p>Of the myſticall ſenſe of the laſt branch of this cenſure, I infer the third neceſſary concluſion, that it is impoſſible for the regenerate man to fall to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally and finally from the grace of his ſpirituall love, whereby he is ſpiritually and indiviſibly united to his myſticall head: For Satan with all his power, is not able to make the regenerate man to ſin, as he is a ſpirituall man; for he is born of God, much leſſe to fall totally and finally from the grace of his ſpirituall love, and indiviſibly united to the truth of the Lords merit.</p>
               <p>Thus having declared the literall and myſticall ſenſe of the cenſure upon the ſenſitive Serpent, and upon the old Serpent Satan, in particular; and alſo the literall and myſticall ſenſe of the three branches of this cenſure, as it doth concern the Serpent, and the Serpents ſeed, and the woman and her ſeed, literally and myſtically. Before we come to the declaration of the cenſure upon the laſt two delinquents in particular: Firſt, the ſecond co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, comprehended in the ſecond branch of this cenſure, is to be ſet down according to the literall and myſticall ſenſe.</p>

               <head type="sub">The ſecond covenant in the promiſe of the bleſſed ſeed, entred with Adam the redeemed head of all men, which is called the old covenant.</head>
               <p>IN the opening the ſecond covenant, in the promiſe of the bleſſed ſeed, two two things are firſt neceſſarily to be obſerved:</p>
               <p>Firſt, as the firſt covenant was made with Adam, as under the name of Adam, man male, and female, was neceſſarily comprehended; for ſo Adam is the head of all men naturally to deſcend of Adam: So the ſecond cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant is made with Adam in his redeemed ſtate (though then unknown to Adam) as under the name of Adam, both man male, and female, is compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended; for ſo Adam is the redeemed head of all men naturally to deſcend of Adam.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing to be obſerved is, that (according to the eternall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of God) the redemption of man, (in the promiſe of the bleſſed ſeed) was in every reſpect as actuall to man in the promiſe by the ſecond covenant, as after the promiſe was fulfilled by the new covenant. To come therefore to the covenant: God in the majeſty of his incenſed wrath againſt the ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive creature, called the Serpent, for betraying of man, did, as a terrible Judge, in the preſence of our firſt parents, by his Word, pronounce the curſe of the Law upon this ſenſitive creature, ſo beloved of our firſt parents; by the immediate power of whoſe (all commanding) Word, down falleth this ſenſitive creature, from walking upon the legs (as other cattle and beaſts of field) to craul in a moſt fearfull deſpicable and loathſome manner upon the belly, to lick up and feed upon the duſt of the earth.

                  </gap>us promiſe (that the ſeed of the woman ſhall break the head of the Serpent,) is this: The Word ſhall be made fleſh of the ſeed of the woman, that as Satan by the ſenſitive Serpent did firſt deceive
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:49359:51"/> the woman, ſo the old Serpent, Satans head, ſhall be broke by man, the ſeed of the woman. This gracious promiſe was to be fulfilled: Firſt, by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of the bleſſed ſeed (the Word made fleſh of the ſeed of the woman) from the grave (his laſt enemy) to the face of the earth, whereby he did mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt himſelf God and man, by his reſt from the fulfilling of the promiſe of the bleſſed ſeed. Secondly, by his reſurrection from the face of the earth to the heavens from whence he came; whereby he did manifeſt himſelf again by his infinite power, God and man, from whence he ſhall return again the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time in all glory and majeſty, united to his myſticall members, who is the myſticall man that muſt break the head of the Serpent Satan, and the ſeed of his curſed ſeed, to their eternall confuſion. This laſt promiſed reſt of the bleſſed ſeed (the Word to be made fleſh of the ſeed of the woman) doth neceſſarily preſuppoſe and imply his bloody reſt in the grave from his curſed death of the croſſe, whoſe merit by his bloody reſt, (as he is the eternall Son of God, begot of the ſeed of the woman in time) was twofold:</p>
               <p>Firſt, by his reſt from the curſed death of the croſſe, our Saviour was to merit the redemption of all men condemned to the curſe of the Law of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe for the ſin of Adam, whereby all men in Adam their redeemed head, were ſaved from the firſt death.</p>
               <p>Secondly, by his bloody reſt in the grave upon the ſeventh day of the Law (from end to end) by his fulfilling of the Law, in the ſeventh day (as he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged himſelf to man,) the eternall life and reſt of the firſt ſeventh day, loſt by Adam, was due by the Law, to his merit, that by faith in his merit, all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed men might reſt by faith, till the promiſe was fulfilled, whereby, as all faithfull redeemed men were ſaved from the ſecond death, which is the curſe of the Law of righteouſneſſe of faith for actuall ſin: So, by the fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the promiſe of the bleſſed ſeed by his reſurrection from the grave, all faithfull believers are now ſaved from the ſecond death, which is the curſe of the Evangelicall Law of righteouſneſſe of faith for actuall ſin: And this is the myſticall ſenſe of this gracious promiſe which was made to Adam the redeemed head of man, and to all men naturally to deſcend of Adam; and was really fulfilled by the Lord Jeſus Chriſt: The benefit of which gracious promiſe was then actually to Adam, and to all men to deſcend of Adam, though the promiſe was to be fulfilled in time: For, by vertue of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, the word of the Law, and life of Righteouſneſſe, firſt written in the heart of man, was then the redeemed word of the Law of righteouſneſſe of faith, whereby Adam was morally enabled to believe the promiſe; and by believing in the promiſed reſt of the bleſſed ſeed, to have eternall life. But before the ſecond covenant can be declared, whereby God doth oblige him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:49359:52"/> and Adam in this gracious promiſe; firſt the word of the ſeventh dayes reſt muſt be ſet down, upon the immediate command whereof the ſecond covenant was eſtabliſhed between God and man: For, without the light of the word of this ſeventh dayes promiſed reſt, the ſecond covenant can no wayes be known; for the knowledge whereof, we muſt neceſſarily under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that the day wherein this gracious promiſe was made to Adam, was the ſeventh day of the Law, from the creation by morall account, as man na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally deſcended of Adam the head, is obliged to the Law of God. And this doth plainly appear by the words of the fourth Precept of the Decalogue ſet down to Moſes, where it is ſaid: <hi>Remember the Sabbath day be kept holy, ſix dayes ſhalt thou labour, and do all thy work; but the ſeventh day</hi> (to wit, whereby Adam was obliged to the Law of righteouſneſſe, by the firſt cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in his ſtate of perfection) <hi>is now the promiſed reſt;</hi> or <hi>Sabbath of the Lord thy God,</hi> to wit, the promiſed bleſſed ſeed, who hath promiſed to reſt upon the Sabbath day in his ſacred grave for the redemption of man from the curſe of the Law for the ſin of Adam, and to riſe from the grave to break the Serpents head, for the betraying of man to fall under the eternall curſe of the Law. The reaſon is given: For, <hi>in ſix dayes the Lord made heaven and earth, the ſea, and all that therein is; Wherefore the Lord bleſſed the ſeventh day, and hallowed it:</hi> that is to ſay, as the Lord by his reſt from the works of the creation did bleſſe the firſt ſeventh day of his Law for man, and did ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the firſt ſeventh day for his worſhip by man: So from his promiſed reſt from the works of the redemption of man, the Lord hath bleſſed the Sabbath day for man, and hath ſanctified the Sabbath day for his worſhip by man.</p>
               <p>This day therefore, wherein this gracious promiſe was made, was the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day by morall account from the creation, ſanctified by the word of promiſe, then by the name of the Sabbath of the Lord to Adam. This graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous promiſe made to Adam, being to be performed in time, was formally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheticall, and conſequently the Sabbath day wherein this promiſe was made, was likewiſe formally propheticall: For, by the literall light of the propheticall Sabbath day, Adams faith was led to reſt upon the promiſed reſt of the bleſſed ſeed. And this is the reaſon that our Saviour ſaid, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.13, <hi>The Law and Prophets did propheſie to</hi> John. For the Law did then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie by the Sabbath, which did neceſſarily imply the whole Law of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe of faith, in the promiſe of the bleſſed ſeed; where it is to be marked, that the Lord ſaith, that the Law did propheſie to John, leſt the Jewes might conceive that the firſt ſeventh day of the Law obliging Adam did propheſie, which did no wayes propheſie. Now, becauſe this promiſed reſt of the bleſſed ſeed upon the Sabbath was propheticall and myſticall;
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:49359:52"/> therefore for the ſtrenghthening of Adams faith, and the faith of the Fathers in the promiſe, the formall worſhip in the propheticall Sabbath was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to be celebrate by the ceremoniall Altar, prefigurating the curſed Altar of the croſſe; and by the ceremoniall ſacrifice of the altar, prefigura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the curſed death of the bleſſed ſeed; that as Adam faith, by the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall light of the Altar, and ſacrifice, might be led to the curſed death of the bleſſed ſeed: So by the literall light of the Sabaticall ſeventh day of the Law of righteouſneſſe of faith, Adams faith might be moral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly led to the grave of the bleſſed ſeed; and from the grave to his reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the grave, for the breaking of the head of the Serpent: In which commanded formall worſhip by the ceremoniall altar and ſacrifice, all the rites and ceremonies of the ceremoniall Law are implied and immediately referred to the Altar and ſacrifice; as the altar and ſacrifice is immediately referred to the propheticall Sabbath, as it is the great command of the Law, implying the whole command of the Law of righteouſneſſe of faith in the promiſe of the bleſſed ſeed. Thus having declared the word of the ſecond ſeventh dayes promiſed reſt of the Law of righteouſneſſe of faith, upon the immediate command whereof the ſecond covenant is eſtabliſhed; I come next to the declaration of the ſecond covenant.</p>
               <p>God therefore, in this gracious word of promiſe doth firſt bind and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged himſelf by covenant to Adam the redeemed head of man, and in Adam to all men naturally to deſcend of Adam, that the word ſhould be made man of the ſeed of the woman, by whom the old Serpents head ſhould be broke, by whoſe merit (by his promiſed reſt) Adam ſhould have eternall life. And becauſe this promiſe of eternall life was to be enjoyed by the bleſſing of the ſeventh dayes Sabaticall promiſed reſt; God therefore doth mutually bind and oblige Adam the redeemed head of man, to believe the promiſe, and by his faithfull morall and ceremoniall works of worſhip, to worſhip God upon the Sabbath as God did reveal himſelf to Adam by his promiſed Sabaticall ſeventh dayes reſt; God of the Law of righteouſneſſe of faith, in three di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct perſons of the Trinity, Creator and Redemeer of man. And becauſe Adam (by the redeemed word of the Law and life of righteouſneſſe of faith in his heart) was morally enabled to that formal commanded moral and cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall worſhip: God doth likewiſe bind Adam the redeemed head of man, upon the finall contempt of his commanded worſhip to eternall death; as if the word of the covenant were thus: Whoſoever ſhall believe in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of the bleſſed ſeed, ſhall be ſaved from the ſecond death, as by my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed reſt from the redemption of man, he is ſaved from the firſt death, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſover ſhall not believe, ſhall be condemned. Now, as the formall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:49359:53"/> worſhip of the ſeventh day of the Law of righteouſneſſe of faith is obliged by the ſecond covenant: Adam is commanded to worſhip God upon the ſeventh day of the prophetic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſe of the Law of righteouſneſſe of faith; in which commanded formall worſhip, as the ſeventh day of the propheticall Sabbath was then the great command of the Law of faith, all the morall and ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall works of faith are neceſſarily commanded. To the continuance of man, in which works of faith (till Gods prefixed time of ſpirituall calling) the grace of ſpirituall faith is promiſed by covenant: for, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.13. <hi>Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſhall endure to the end ſhall be ſaved,</hi> which is the ſaving of man from the ſecond death by ſpirituall faith.</p>
               <p>By faith in this promiſed reſt of the bleſſed ſeed of Adam, and the Fathers before Moſes, and the Fathers after Moſes, till the promiſe was fulfilled, were ſaved: For, the formall morall propheticall and ceremoniall obligement of the Law of righteouſneſſe of faith was really and formally one and the ſame, till the promiſe was fulfilled: For, as the morall and ceremoniall Law given to Moſes in diſtinct precepts was neceſſarily implied in the command of the word of the ſeventh day of the propheticall Sabbath to Adam, and to the Fathers before Moſes: So the diſtinct precepts of the ceremoniall Law given to Moſes, were as neceſſarily implied in the ceremoniall command of the altar and ſacrifice, for all the rites and ceremonies of the ceremoniall Law, and immediatly referred to the altar and ſacrifice, as the command of the ceremoniall altar and ſacrifice is immediately referred to the formall commanded worſhip of the Sabbath. Hence I inferre this neceſſary conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; Adam and the Fathers before Moſes, having the ſeventh day of the propheticall Sabbath, implying the command of the whole Law of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of faith in the promiſe of the bleſſed ſeed, and the ceremoniall altar and ſacrifice, implying all the ceremoniall Law: Adam and the Fathers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Moſes, had the morall and ceremoniall Law, and were thereby as really obliged, as after the morall and ceremoniall Law was given to Moſes. And therefore it is ſaid, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.3, 4. that the Fathers did eat of the ſame ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall bread, and drink of the ſame ſpirituall Rock with us; for that Rock was the bleſſed ſeed, to Adam and the Fathers, which is now to us, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; and therefore it is likewiſe ſaid, that the Evangel was preached to them, to wit, myſtically and prophetically, as it is preached to us cleerly and Evangelically. To conclude the ſecond covenant, called the old cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, I inferre the ſecond formall obligement of the Law of God by the old covenant.</p>
               <pb n="97" facs="tcp:49359:53"/>
               <p>As, the firſt word of promiſe to Adam the created head of man in his ſtate of perfection, was eternall life, by the reſt of the Law of righteouſneſſe upon the firſt ſeventh day from the works of the creation: So the ſecond word of promiſe to Adam the redeemed head of man, is eternall life by the promiſed reſt of God of the Law of righteouſneſſe of faith, the Redeemer of man, by his promiſed reſt upon the Sabbath from the works of the redemption.</p>
               <p>Firſt therefore, this promiſed reſt of the bleſſed ſeed upon the Sabbath, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing formally propheticall; conſequently the formall worſhip of the ſeventh day of the propheticall Sabbath, obliged by the ſecond covenant was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally propheticall; and therefore typically and ceremonially commanded, upon the performing of which commanded worſhip by Adam the ſecond covenant is eſtabliſhed.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the propheticall Sabbaticall ſeventh day of the Law, as it is the great co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand of the Law, implying the command of the whole Law of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe of faith, being prophetically and ceremonially obliged, the whole Law of righteouſneſſe of faith is prophetically and ceremonially obliged, commanding Adam firſt and immediatly to the formall propheticall ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall worſhip of the propheticall Sabbath of the Lord, both upon the eternall bleſſing of the Sabbaticall ſeventh days promiſed reſt to his faithfull worſhip, and upon the curſe of eternall death to his finall contempt of that comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded formall worſhip, neceſſarily implying the contempt of the whole Law: For, as in the commanded worſhip of the ſeventh day of the Law, (as it is the great command of the Law, neceſſarily implying the leſſer command) all the powers of man, proceeding from his faithfull love to God, are neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commanded: So by the finall contempt of the formall commanded wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the ſeventh day of the Law, the whole Law is neceſſarily tranſgreſſed. Hence I inferre theſe two Theologicall demonſtrative concluſions.</p>
               <p>Firſt, as neceſſarily as by the ſecond covenant, the faith of man was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to the faithfull propheticall and ceremoniall worſhip of the propheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Sabbath; upon the promiſe of eternall life to his faith, and eternall death to his infidelity: So the works of faith, whereby the propheticall and ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remoniall worſhip of the Sabbath was to be performed, were as neceſſarily commanded by the command of the ſeventh day of the propheticall Sabbath, both upon the eternall bleſſing of the Sabbaticall ſeventh dayes reſt of the Law of righteouſneſs of faith, and upon the eternall curſe of the Law of faith.</p>
               <p>Secondly, though the propheticall and ceremoniall works of faith were neceſſarily commanded by the Law; yet the bleſſing of the eternall promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed reſt of the bleſſed ſeed, was due by the Law immediately to faith, and not to the works of faith: The reaſon is, becauſe it was by the Spirit of faith,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:49359:54"/> that the merit of the promiſed reſt of the bleſſed ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d was to be apprehended, and not by the greateſt works of faith, which hath no ſpirit at all. And therefore the eternall bleſſing of the ſeventh dayes promiſed reſt of the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſeed, by the Law of righteouſneſſe of faith, was not due by the Law to the greateſt morall or ceremoniall works of Adam; but immediately to the merit of man, the promiſed bleſſed ſeed, by the immediate power of whole redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed word of the Law and life of righteouſneſſe of faith, written in the heart of Adam: Adam was morally enabled to believe the promiſe, and to produce the morall and ceremoniall works of faith, as by the ſpirituall grace of faith in Gods prefixed time, Adam was ſpiritually enabled with the ſpirituall grace of faith by the hands of ſpirituall faith, to apprehend the merit of the bleſſed ſeed by his promiſed reſt; by which ſpirituall union, Adams faith, and the merit of the bleſſed ſeed were really and indiviſibly one, whereby Adam was ſaved from the ſecond death, which is the curſe of the Law of faith. And ſo much for the literall and myſticall ſenſe of the ſecond covenant comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the ſecond branch of the cenſure, as the cenſure doth concern the woman and her ſeed. We proceed therefore next to the cenſure of God upon the two laſt delinquents, for the tranſgreſſion of the Law of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe obliged by the firſt covenant.</p>

               <p>FOr the better conceiving of the cenſure of God upon the laſt two de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquents, for the tranſgreſſion of the Law of righteouſneſſe, by the firſt covenant, it is neceſſarily to be underſtood, that Adam is ſaid to be the head of man, after a twofold manner: Firſt, as under the name of Adam, man male and female is comprehended: For, ſo Adam is the created head of all men, naturally deſcended, and to deſcend of Adam; and in this ſenſe, as all men are ſaid to have ſinned in Adam, the created head of all men, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.18. ſo all men are ſaid to be redeemed in Adam, the redeemed head of man, from the curſe of eternall death and darkneſſe, by the promiſed reſt of the bleſſed ſeed, from the redemption of man from the curſe of the Law, and by the eternall decree of God ſhut up in temporall ſpirituall darkneſſe, called unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, and originall ſin, and temporall naturall death, which followed that ſin, which was then (according to the eternall decree of God) pronounced up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Adam th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The cenſure upon the woman is ſet down by Moſes in theſe words: <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.16. <hi>I will greatly multiply thy ſorrows, and thy conceptions: In ſorrow ſhalt thou bring forth children, and thy deſire ſhall be to thy husband, and he ſhall rule over thee.</hi> The cenſure hath a literall and myſticall ſenſe: Firſt, of the literall ſenſe of the cenſure, which is pronounced upon the woman in particular, as ſhe is the wife and body of her husband. The cenſure doth divide it ſelf into two branches: to wit, ſorrow in conception and child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>birth; and ſubjection to the husband. Firſt, of the literall ſenſe of the two branches; and next of the myſticall ſenſe: As this ſorrow in the infinite mercy of God (at that time) was not without greateſt comfort to women: ſo it is with no leſſe comfort to women at this preſent: For, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> in the bringing forth of children, the promiſe of the bleſſed ſeed, was confirmed to be born of the ſeed of the woman; by whoſe curſed death, the curſe of the Law was removed from man; the benefit whereof our firſt parents did then actually enjoy, though the bleſſed child was afterwards to be born, according to the eternal decree of God. So there is great comfort at this time, (under the Law of Grace) in the bringing forth of children by women: For the child is brought forth actually freed from the curſe of the Law for the ſin of Adam, by the firſt covenant, and born a hopefull member of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. And though it doth pleaſe God (many times) to take away the childe by tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall death; yet it is no ſmall comfort to the ſorrowfull parents, that the childe is a glorious Saint in heaven.</p>
               <p>It is ſaid here, <hi>I will greatly multiply,</hi> (or increaſe) <hi>thy ſorrows,</hi> becauſe of the pronounced enmity between the old Serpent Satan and his ſeed, and the woman and her ſeed; of whoſe continuall afflictions the woman is never free, while ſhe is in this life. And now her ſorrows are increaſed by her
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:49359:55"/> conception and bringing forth of children, which are inflicted upon women, to the end that the woman in her greateſt extremity (by her ſorrow in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception and childbirth) ſhould be put in mind of the eternall ſorrows and pains of eternall death (by the firſt covenant) from which ſhe was redeemed by the bleſſed childe then to be born; and now born of the ſeed of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, upon whoſe merit, Eves faith may ſafely reſt, as upon a rock, from any fear of the ſecond death, by the new covenant; In which ſenſe, only the words of the Apoſtle are to be conceived, to wit, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.15. that women are ſaved through the bearing of children; for by the extremity of their pains, they are put to it, to flie to Chriſt the only Author of faith, by whoſe only me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit the woman is only ſaved. And this likewiſe is the reaſon that it is ſaid, <hi>John</hi> 16.21. that the ſorrows and pains of childbirth are forgotten, becauſe man is brought into the world: For, it is a great joy and comfort to all men and women, that man is brought into the world, freed from the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall curſe of the Law for the ſin of Adam, and a hopefull member of the Church of God, and of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. And though ſorrow and pain in conception and childbirth, be a great weakning to women, leading to naturall death; and though childbirth many times be accompanied with the loſſe of naturall life to the mother; yet it is with great advantage to the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, the childe of God, while by the determining of all the ſorrows, croſſes and afflictions of this life, ſhe enters to the eternall joyes in the life to come.</p>
               <p>It is true, that it doth pleaſe God to give ſuch ſtrength of nature to divers thankleſſe women, whereby they are more able to bear this ſorrow and pains in conc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>tion and childbirth, then other women; but for the moſt part, this ſorrow and pain in childbirth, is fearfull, ſudden, and dangerous; in ſo much that while God doth threaten the diſobedience of man by his unexpected judgements, they are expreſſed by the ſudden dangerous unexpected ſorrows and pains of women in childbirth. And though it may be conceived that ſome women barren and childleſſe are happy in this caſe, as not being ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to ſuch temporall danger and hazard; yet, I ſay, that the fruitfulneſſe of women, doth far exceed the fear of ſuch hazard and danger, for children are the greateſt bleſſings of God, and a great comfort, both to poor and rich. And though (for the moſt part) children too too often prove croſſes and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions to the parents, ſtirred up by the temptations of Satan, and of his wicked inſtruments, which is a ſore affliction to the parents, yet it is the hand of God in permitting of Satan to afflict their parents by their children, to put them in minde of their own diſobedience to G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="101" facs="tcp:49359:55"/> Kingdome of heaven. Againſt this here delivered, it may be objected: Though man had ſtood in his ſtate of perfection; yet woman muſt have had ſuch ſorrow and pains in conception and childbirth; for they are the inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable companions of both. I anſwer, Grief, ſorrow and pain, and ſenſitive perfection, do mutually plant and ſubplant one another; for paſſion by ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and grief, is the immediate cauſe of moſt ſenſitive diſeaſes. Sorrow and grief therefore, is far from that ſtate of ſenſitive perfection, wherein man was created, which was eternall. In which ſtate, if man had continued, the woman muſt have had eternall joy and comfort upon earth, without all ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive ſorrow, pain, or grief, either in conception or childbirth. But, in the mean time, let it not trouble any married woman, barren of children, becauſe the Apoſtle ſaith, that women are ſaved through child-bearing; for the Apoſtles meaning is, that the extremity of labour and fear in childbirth, is a means to move the woman to flie to the Lord by faith, and to relie upon the Lords merit, to ſave her from the ſecond death; and, if it be his will, from the preſent danger of childbirth; and therefore the Apoſtle ſaith, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.15. that the woman is ſaved through bearing of children, if ſhe continue in faith, love, holineſſe and modeſty, which are the true works of faith, by which faith ſhe is only ſaved. Far be it threfore from any woman to conceive that child-bearing is the cauſe of any womans ſafety from eternall death, which is only and immediately by faith, in the only merit of the Lord of life. Let never therefore the barrenneſſe of child-bearing diſcourage woman, if ſhe continue in the fruitfull works of faith; for by faith ſhe is only ſaved. And though ſhe be denied the bearing of children in this miſerable age, while ſo many of the children of faithfull parents are led away with the crying ſins of the times, and miſcarry to the great ſorrow and grief of their parents; yet let her not take her barrenneſſe of children for any reproach: For, though barrenneſſe in the time of Abrahams poſterity, <hi>Gen.</hi> 30.23. was counted a reproach amongſt women, before our Saviour was born: <hi>Luke</hi> 1.25. Yet the bleſſed child being born, all reproach of barrenneſſe of children is taken away from women.</p>

               <p>THe ſecond branch of the cenſure literally pronounced upon the woman as ſhe is the body of her husband; is ſubjection to the husband. Hence I neceſſarily infer, that in the ſtate of perfection, before the fall, there was
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:49359:56"/> no other ſubjection of the wife to the husband, but the endeavouring of the wife in all mutuall love to be led and governed by the husband her head.</p>
               <p>This branch of the cenſure therefore, doth ſtand with as great oppoſition to the ſtate of perfection as the former; which doth manifeſtly appear by the twofold inſeparable union of man and wife in the ſtate of perfection, which was both naturall and ſpirituall; the ſtricteſt union that can be conceived by man. The naturall union is ſet down by Moſes in theſe words, <hi>They ſhall be both one fleſh:</hi> For the woman was made of the rib of the man, which is the moſt ſolid and condenſate ſenſitive part of man, as he is ſenſitive; for the matter of the bone is of the blood of man: And therefore when Eve was firſt brought before Adam, Adam (out of the perfection of his naturall under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand) affirmed that Eve was fleſh of his fleſh, and bone of his bone. And therefore called her <hi>Mannes,</hi> according to the originall, affirming her to be man eſſentially, adding only the diſtinction of the ſex of man. In which ſenſe, the Apoſtle doth call the woman <hi>mans own fleſh.</hi> So that if man love his own fleſh naturally, he muſt love his wife as himſelf, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.29. The ſecond union of man and wife in the ſtate of perfection, was ſpirituall; for both were equally created in the lively Image of God, in the indiviſible uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of mutuall ſpirituall love to righteouſneſſe, far ſurmounting the moſt ſtrict union under the heavens.</p>
               <p>By this twofold inſeparable union of man and wife in the ſtate of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, by matrimoniall union; the union was inſeparable: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our Saviour ſpeaking of Moſes bill of divorcement, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.8. told the Jews that Moſes did permit that bill for the hardneſſe of their heart; and that it was not ſo from the beginning: For, they were created male and fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male, whereby the one did ſtrive to overcome the other by the mutuall offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of love. And this was the greateſt ſubjection of the wiſe to the husband in the ſtate of perfection, which was in this twofold union of mutuall love. And therefore it is ſaid, <hi>Let no man ſeparate whom God hath joyned together,</hi> to wit, in marriage. This inſeparable union of man and wife in the ſtate of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, as it was without any eſſentiall or ſpirituall reall difference; ſo it was equall, without all imperious authority, either of naturall or ſpirituall ſubjection; neither was it poſſible to be otherwiſe: for the naturall and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall love of both, being inſeparably and indiviſibly one, as the love of the head to the body, and of the body to the head: Man the head could no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe command his body, his wife, but by a ſweet pleaſing regiment of love, directing his body, as head, in all naturall and ſpirituall love. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore woman was made neither of the loweſt or higheſt part of man, but of the rib, equall in ſituation with the region of the heart. Though this cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:49359:56"/> therefore was pronounced upon woman, as ſhe was the body of her husband, for being the inſtrument to induce her head, Adam, to the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of the Law of God (being firſt betrayed her ſelf, by Satans falſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving bewitching light;) yet let man love and honour woman, who was the happy inſtrument of the greateſt bleſſing that ever came to man or Angel. And therefore now, in this ſtate of Grace, man is by a more ſtrict union, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to love his wife, then if man had ſtood in the ſtate of his created per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection: For, by his firſt eſtate, man had been but an earthly creature; for his perfection muſt have been eternally upon earth, while as the woman is the happy inſtrument that man is advanced, to be crowned with an incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible crown of glory in the kingdome of heaven eternally. And this is the reaſon, that the husband, even now in the ſtate of Grace, is to love his wife as himſelf; and to expreſſe his love, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.33. by his care in provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and cheriſhing his wife, even as he doth his own naturall life; and that ſhe may be as dear to him as his naturall life. And conſequently, to bear much with the weakneſſe of her ſex; for otherwiſe man muſt manifeſt his baſe unthankfulneſſe, both to God and to woman, whom God hath made the happy inſtrument of ſo great a bleſſing, never to be forgotten by man. Let no man therefore think, that the woman is given him to wife to be made his ſlave; but to love her as his own naturall body: As the wife his body is to love her head, as a mutuall help and comfort to her head, (to her full power) with all ſubmiſſive reverence in love to be directed by her head. This ſubjection therefore is ſtill in the ſweet regiment of love without all uſurping imperious authority or rigorous command.</p>
               <p>Here it may be objected: <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.37. Adam is puniſhed for giving way to his wifes perſwaſion, and conſequently, Adam had an imperious authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty over his wife, in the ſtate of perfection.</p>
               <p>I anſwer: This Text doth neceſſarily inferre an equall and mutuall love, between Adam and Eve, and no wayes any imperious authority of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; neither doth God puniſh Adam ſimply for being perſwaded by his wifes love, but becauſe Adam did preferre the love of his wife to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of his gracious God and Creator, to whoſe infinite love, both Adam and Eve were ſo infinitely obliged. In which reſpect all the love and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of man and woman, whoſoever muſt be miſregarded: And ſo much for the two branches of the cenſure pronounced againſt the woman as ſhe is the body of her husband her head.

               <head type="sub">The myſticall ſenſe of the two branches of the cenſure pronounced upon the woman, as ſhe is the body of man her husband.</head>
               <p>BY the myſticall ſenſe of this cenſure (literally pronounced upon the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man) as ſhe is the body of her husband: Firſt, by the woman; the Church of God is myſtically to be underſtood: As by the husband, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the head and husband of the Church. Secondly, by the concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and the bringing forth of children by the woman, the conception and bringing forth of the morall and ſpirituall children of the Church (by the Miniſters of the Word) is myſtically ſignified: For, by the preaching of the Word, and by the Miniſters exemplary inſtruction, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.2. (in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon) the children of the Church, are, firſt, brought forth (by morall faith) to know and practiſe the works of faith, that morall obedience may be given to the Word. Thirdly, by the ſorrow and grief of the woman in conceiving and bringing forth of children; the ſorrow, grief, and pains of the Miniſter, is myſtically ſignified, by his hard conceiving and bringing forth of the rebellious natural man, nuzled up in the luſts and pleaſures of the fleſh, by the continued temptation of Satan and his ſeed, whereby the naturall man is led to all wickedneſſe of life, to the ſorrow and grief of the whole Church: As by the joy of the woman, that man is brought forth in the world; the joy of the Church at the converſion of the penitent ſinner, is myſtically ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified. Fourthly, by the barrenneſſe of the woman in bringing forth of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; not only the Miniſters barrenneſſe, in the neglect of his weighty cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, but alſo, the barrenneſſe of faith, in the particular members of the Church, is myſtically ſignified. Fifthly, by the ſecond conception of the woman, while by the intellectuall information of the Infant in the womb (by the immediate act of God) man (as he is man) is conceived and brought forth man by the woman; the ſpirituall conception of the rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate man by the Church, whereby he is brought forth a ſpirituall man, is myſtically ſignified: For, in the act of regeneration, the naturall man having continued in his morall obedience to the preaching of the Word, till Gods prefixed time of ſpirituall calling, the naturall mans ſpirituall darkneſſe is enlightned by the immediate ſpirituall light of the Lords ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit, by ſpirituall faith, whereby he is actually regenerate, and ſo conceived and brought by the Church, a myſticall indiviſible member of his myſticall head, to the great joy and comfort of the Church. Sixth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by the ſtrict naturall and ſpirituall union between man and wife, the ſtrict union of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt to his body (the Church) is myſtically
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:49359:57"/> ſignified, which is both naturall and ſpirituall: For, as the Church (his body) is fleſh of his naturall fleſh, and bone of his bones, (as he is man, of the ſeed of the woman) ſo the Church, (morally and ſpiritually brought forth) is of the ſame ſpirit with the head, whereby the head and body are ſpiritually, myſtically, and indiviſibly united, ariſing of the eſſentiall ſpirituall union and unction of the divine and humane nature of the Word, in the womb of the bleſſed Virgin. Seventhly, by the ſubjected deſire of the woman to her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band; (which is in all mutuall love) the ſubjected love and deſire of the Church, to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt (the head) is myſtically ſignified; who out of his infinite love to his Church, by fulfilling of his promiſe to man, as he did ſubject the deſire of his own naturall life, to the curſed death of the croſſe, to manifeſt himſelf truth to man: So his myſticall members are to ſubject all their love and deſire, to his will, and to preferre the love of his truth to the love of their own naturall lives; for he is unworthy of the crown of life, (ſo dearly purchaſed by the merit of his truth) who for any worldly reſpect whatſoever, doth unthankfully deny his truth before men in this life. And ſo much for the literall and myſticall ſenſe of the cenſure pronounced upon the woman, as ſhe is the body and wife of her husband.

               <p>THe laſt cenſure is pronounced by God, upon Adam (the laſt delinquent) as he is the head and husband of the woman, his body and wife by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimoniall union: For, in this ſenſe only Adam is the redeemed head of all men naturally to deſcend of Adam. The cenſure is ſet down (by Moſes) in theſe words, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.17, 18, 19 <hi>Becauſe thou haſt harkened unto the voyce of thy wife, and haſt eaten of the tree of which I commanded thee, ſaying, Thou ſhalt not eat of it. Curſed is the earth for thy ſake: in ſorrow ſhalt thou eat of it all the dayes of thy life: Thornes alſo, and Thiſtles ſhall it bring forth to thee; and thou ſhalt eat of the herb of the field: In the ſweat of thy face thou ſhalt eat bread; till thou return unto the earth: For out of it waſt thou taken; for duſt thou art, and unto duſt ſhalt thou return.</hi> Firſt, the cauſe of the cenſure is ſet down; and next the cenſure is pronounced. The ſenſe and meaning of the cauſe of the cenſure, is this; becauſe thou haſt obeyed the voyce of thy wife, and haſt moſt unthankfully preferred her love to thy love, to me thy gracious God and Creator, and haſt contemned my command, (which is the command of
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:49359:58"/> me, God of the Law of Righteouſneſſe) and haſt eaten of the fruit whereof I commanded thee that thou ſhouldeſt not eat: Next the cenſure is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, which hath a literall and myſticall ſenſe. The literall ſenſe of the cenſure is ſet down from the eighteenth verſe, to the end of the chapter, and hath four branches: The firſt is, <hi>curſed is the earth for thy ſake:</hi> By the ſecond branch of the cenſure, naturall death is inflicted upon Adam, as he is the head of the woman his body, and redeemed head of man. Thirdly, Adam is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded Paradiſe, to till the ground: Fourthly, the Cherubims, and the fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming ſword, are placed at the Eaſt of the Garden of Eden, to keep man from entring to the tree of Life, growing in the earthly Paradiſe. Firſt, therefore of this curſe inflicted upon the earth.</p>
               <p>This curſe inflicted upon the earth, is no wayes to be taken for the curſe of the Law: For, firſt the earth did no wayes come within the compaſſe of the tranſgreſſion of the Law: Secondly, the curſe of the Law (which is eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall,) is cleerly taken away from man, and from the creatures created for man, by the promiſed curſed death of the bleſſed ſeed, except the only curſe which was inflicted upon the ſenſitive Serpent. And therefore this curſe of the earth is only a privation of the former fertilnes, and a poſitive barrennes, inflicted upon the earth, inſtead of that fertilneſſe, that by that means of that poſitive barrenneſſe, the earth might bring forth Thiſtles &amp; Thorns; for Adam was then (by the cenſure) to eat bread of the herbs of the field, that is, of the corn and grain which was to grow upon the barren earth; and therefore, Adam, (by his toil, labour, and pains) was to bring ſome fertilneſſe upon the earth, or Adam muſt ſtarve; by means of which toil, pains, and labour, Adam muſt eat his bread in ſorrow and care, in the ſweat of his face, by which forced ſweat, ſurfets and colds muſt ariſe, weakning the ſenſitive ſpirits and powers of man, inducing temporall naturall death in the end. But though this barrenneſſe was inflicted upon the earth for man; yet in the great mercy of God by the power of the redeemed word in the heart of man: Firſt, man is naturally enabled by his labour, pains and induſtry, to procure ſome fertil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe upon the earth: And therefore it is ſaid, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.10. that he that doth not work and labour, is not to eat: Secondly, by the power of the redeemed word of the Law and life of righteouſneſſe of faith written in the heart of man, man is morally enabled to pray for the bleſſing of God upon his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and pains, who hath promiſed to hear his prayers; by whoſe only bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, the curſe of barrenneſſe is taken from the earth: Thirdly, for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending of man from the danger of his heats and colds, God in his mercy, did cloath our firſt parents with skins. By the ſecond branch of the cenſure in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted upon Adam (the redeemed head of man;) Adam, and all men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:49359:58"/> in Adam, ſhall return to duſt, which is to be underſtood of temporall naturall death, by the diſſolution of the intellectuall and ſenſitive nature of man: And therefore their ſin is ſet down, Becauſe thou waſt taken out of the duſt of the earth, <hi>to duſt thou ſhalt return:</hi> But Adams humane ſpirit, with the word of the Law, and life of Righteouſneſſe, ſpiritually and indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly written therein, was neither taken out of the duſt of the earth, neither can it return to duſt. For, firſt, humane ſpirit is neceſſarily coeviternall with the Word and Law of God: Secondly, humane ſpirit is of the ſame reall ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cificall ſphere with the humane Spirit of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, as hath been formerly demonſtrate, which was never taken from the earth, or can return to the duſt of the earth. Temporall naturall death therefore, by this branch of the cenſure, is i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>flicted upon Adam, as he is the head of his body, the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who is fleſh of his fleſh, and bone of his bone; and therefore naturall temporall death being inflicted upon the head, is neceſſarily likewiſe inflicted upon the body, the woman; and conſequently and neceſſarily upon all men and women naturally to deſcend of both: For, in this ſenſe only, Adam is the redeemed head of all redeemed men, naturally to deſcend of Adam. By the third branch of the cenſure, Adam, the redeemed head of man, (and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the woman) are excluded out of the earthly Paradiſe; the reaſon is ſet down: Leſt they ſhould eat of the tree of Life, as they did formerly at their pleaſure: For, there was a ſingular vertue in the tree of Life, to maintain the ſenſitive natu e of man eternally; by the eternall preſervation whereof, the union of the intellectuall and ſenſitive nature of man was eternall; for by this eternall union, man was to have continued eternally upon earth, in the ſtate and felicity wherein he was created.</p>
               <p>It was therefore the infinite mercy of God to man, to caſt man out of the earthly Paradiſe: For, if man had had that freedome to eat of the tree of Life, as he had formerly, man muſt have lived in ſorrow and miſery, ſubject to the continuall temptation and afflictions of Satan, and of his wicked ſeed eternally in this life; while as then by faith in the promiſed bleſſed ſeed, Adam, (the redeemed head of man) after this life, ſhould live in the heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Paradiſe eternally in all joy and happineſſe.</p>
               <p>For this cauſe (by the fourth branch of this cenſure) the Cherubims and the flaming ſword, were placed at the Eaſt of the Garden, to keep the way of the tree of Life, that man ſhould not come to the tree of Life, growing in the earthly Paradiſe, by the way which he run before. Next therefore of the myſticall ſenſe of the cenſure. The main myſticall point of this cenſure inflicted upon Adam (as he is the head of the woman, and the redeemed head of man) is to let our firſt parents underſtand, that the word (the promiſed
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:49359:59"/> bleſſed ſeed to be made fleſh of the ſeed of the woman) is the ſecond perſon of the bleſſed Trinity.</p>
               <p>Firſt, therefore by the curſe inflicted upon the earth, the curſe of the Law for the ſin of Adam, to which Adam, and all men naturally to deſcend of Adam, the created head of man, were condemned, is myſtically ſignified. To the end that all men might then, and now know, that all men were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed from that curſe of eternall death and darkneſſe; and that all men are concluded in temporall ſpirituall darkneſſe, called unbelief, and originall ſin; and that naturall death, by the cenſure of God, did follow that ſin. And therefore it is ſaid, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.12.14. As by one man ſin entred in the world, and death by ſin, ſo death went overall men, from Adam to Moſes.</p>
               <p>Secondly, by the ſorrow, labour and pains, and ſweat of the face which ariſeth to man, by reaſon of the curſe of barrenneſſe inflicted upon the earth, whereby it doth produce Thiſtles and Thornes, which are to be weeded out by the care and labour of man, is myſtically ſignified: the ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, labour, ſweaty pains, and prickly thorny afflictions, which our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, the promiſed bleſſed ſeed, was to ſuſtain by the curſe of the Law for man, to put man in continuall remembrance of the never to be forgotten love of God to man, in his Son Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, by the skins, wherewith the Lord clothed and covered our firſt parents nakedneſſe, the righteouſneſſe (which is the skin of the promiſed Lamb of God, to be ſacrificed for the ſins of man) was myſtically ſignified, to the end that our firſt parents might underſtand, that it was by their only faith (in the merit of the righteouſneſſe of the bleſſed ſeed, the Word, to be made fleſh of the ſeed of the woman;) that all their actuall ſins and unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe was covered.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, while as the Lord ſaith, Behold, man is become like one of us, to know good and evill, (whereby our firſt parents did ſee the ſtate which their deſire to know good and evill had brought to:) the Lord would have our firſt parents underſtand that the promiſed Redeemer of man (the bleſſed ſeed) was one of us, that is, one of the diſtinct perſons of the glorious Trinity.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, by the excluding of our firſt parents from the tree of Life growing in the earthly paradiſe, is myſtically ſignified, that our firſt parents were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the tree of Life, growing in the Paradiſe of God, which is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed bleſſed ſeed.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, by the Cherubims and flaming ſword, the morall power and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terall light of the ſword of the Word, is myſtically ſignified, by which only light, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ll redeemed men are morally enlightned, to enter the way of the tree of Life, planted in the heavenly Paradiſe which is the promiſed bleſſed ſeed.</p>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:49359:59"/>
               <p>By this flaming light of the ſword of the Word: Firſt, the flaming light of the redeemed Word of the Law of Righteouſneſſe of faith, written in the heart of man is ſignified, which is the flaming Light of conſcience. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by this flaming Light of the ſword, the flaming literall light of the Word of the ſeventh dayes reſt, of the Law of righteouſneſſe of faith is ſignified, which is of one reall flaming light with the light of the word of the Law and life of Righteouſneſſe of faith, writtten in the heart of man; of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all unity of which flaming light, morall faith doth ariſe; that by the morall hands of faith, the redeemed man may lay morall hold on the word of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, ſhining with the ſame reall flaming light, which was then the tree of Life, growing in the Paradiſe of God, to wit, the promiſed bleſſed ſeed, who is now our tree of life, by his fulfilled promiſe. And though the Cherubims and the flaming ſword were placed at the Eaſt of the Garden of Eden, poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, as it were, to the Land of Canaan, (for the promiſe of the bleſſed ſeed was to be made afterwards to Abraham, and to his ſeed, in a more particular manner then it was made to Adam; which promiſe was to be performed; before the promiſe firſt made to Adam could be fulfilled;) yet the flaming ſword turned every way; that as by the power of the ſword, all men were barred from entring to the tree of Life, growing in the earthly Paradiſe: So that by the flaming light of the ſword of the Word, all redeemed men might be morally enlightned to enter the way to the tree of Life, which is planted in the Paradiſe of God, which is the promiſed bleſſed ſeed. Here (by the way) the queſtion may be moved, whether this barrenneſſe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the earth was curſed for man, doth ſtill remain.</p>

               <p>TO the Queſtion moved in the former Chapter, I anſwer: Though the earth was curſed, by a poſitive barrenneſſe for man; that by his toil, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and pains, he may eat the bread of ſorrow, and the bread of the thorny cares and afflictions of this life, inducing naturall death in the end, to put him in continuall remembrance of the continued ſorrow and afflictions, which the eternall Son of God, the Word (to be made fleſh of the ſeed of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man) by making himſelf a curſe for man, did ſuſtain in this life, induring the curſed death of the croſſe in end; yet the curſe of barrenneſſe is removed, and the fruitfulneſſe of the earth is reſtored by the morall and ſpirituall bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the word of the ſeventh dayes reſt, of the Law of righteouſneſſe of faith; which morall and ſpirituall bleſſing of the Word, <hi>Deut.</hi> 11.14. is called
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:49359:60"/> the firſt and ſecond rain in the Scripture; But yet the earth is not reſtored to the meaſure of the former fruitfulneſſe: The reaſon is, that the redeemed man, by his continuall labour and care, might be put in minde of his thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full obedience to his gracious Redeemer, by his exerciſe in the commanded works of faith, that his faith may be watered with the dew of the morall and ſpirituall bleſſing of the Word.</p>
               <p>This bleſſing of the word of the ſeventh dayes reſt of the Law of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of faith, then to the Fathers in the promiſe of the bleſſed ſeed; and now to us in the fulfilled promiſe is twofold: The firſt is the naturall bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the word to the naturall life of man, as he is man: The ſecond is the morall and ſpirituall bleſſing of the word to the morall and ſpirituall life of man, by the morall and ſpirituall grace of faith: For, without the bleſſing of the nature of the redeemed man, his morall and ſpirituall life muſt periſh in this life. This naturall bleſſing of the word, is freely extended to all redeemed men, without all reſpect to the merit of their obedience, or diſobedience to the command of the Word. And therefore it is ſaid, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.45. That his Sun doth ſhine, and his rain doth fall upon the juſt and unjuſt. And this is, to the end, that as God doth freely confer the bleſſings of the earth without reſpect, to ſome in great plenty, which he hath denyed to many of his redeemed poor members. So the plentiful redeemed man, may out of his plenty, relieve the wants of his redeemed poor brethren, without all reſpect to their merit; who are the Lords redeemed members, whereby the plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full man doth teſtifie his thankfulneſſe to his gracious Redeemer, by the works of mercy and charity, which are the commanded works of faith: For, what is freely given to the Lords poor redeemed members, (who are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled of all means to ſupply their neceſſities,) it is freely given to the Lord himſelf, as may appear by his own words, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.40. <hi>When I was hungry, ye fed me not; when I was thirſtie, ye gave me no drinke; when I was naked, ye clothed me not:</hi> For want of means for the preſervation of the life, is a ſore temptation; which many times is prevented by the charity of the plentifull: For, by ſuch means, the poor indigent wretched man is diverted from at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting unlawfull courſes to ſupply his neceſſity: Though I muſt confeſſe, that plenty (without the ſpeciall dew of the bleſſing of the Word) be the greater and more dangerous temptation of the two. The ſecond bleſſing of the word of the ſeventh dayes reſt of the Law of Righteouſneſſe of faith, is the morall and ſpirituall bleſſing of the word, neceſſarily imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the naturall bleſſing of the word. And this morall and ſpirituall bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing is due by the Law of faith, to the morall and ſpirituall faithfull worſhip of the ſeventh day of the Law of faith: For, by the morall faithfull wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:49359:60"/> of the ſeventh day by the naturall man, and by the ſpirituall faithfull worſhip of the regenerate man by faith in the Lords merit; the whole Law of faith is morally and ſpiritually fulfilled in the ſeventh day of the Law. And therefore the morall and ſpirituall bleſſing of the word of the ſeventh dayes reſt, doth reſt upon the naturall and regenerate man, whereby the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall man is enabled to bring forth the morall works of faith, and to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in his morall obedience, till the time of Gods ſpirituall calling: and the regenerate man is enabled to perſevere and continue in his ſpirituall works of faith by his ſpirituall obedience to the ſpirituall command of the Law of faith. And this is the firſt and ſecond rain, which is the dew of the Lords influence by the bleſſing of his Word; to the grace of the morall and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall faith of man. Thus have we briefly ſet down the literall and myſticall ſenſe of the cenſure, pronounced upon our firſt parents for the tranſgreſſion of the Law of Righteouſneſſe; and the ſecond covenant eſtabliſhed upon the immediate command of the word of the ſeventh dayes promiſed reſt of the Law of Righteouſneſſe of faith then implyed in the propheticall Sabbath, whereby Adam the redeemed head of man, and all men naturally to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend of Adam, were formally, prophetically, and ceremonially obliged to the command of the Law of Righteouſneſſe of faith, in the promiſed reſt of the bleſſed ſeed, which is the laſt part of this ſecond Book; yet, before we proceed, a queſtion is to be reſolved, which is this: How long did this for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall propheticall ceremoniall obligement of the Law of Righteouſneſſe of faith continue, and how long were all redeemed men obliged by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheticall ceremoniall Law of God?</p>

               <head type="sub">The continuation of the formall propheticall ceremoniall obligement of the Law of righteouſneſſe of faith, in the promiſe of the bleſſed ſeed in the firſt age of the Church.</head>
               <p>TO the queſtion moved in the end of the former chapter, I briefly anſwer: The formall obligement of man by the propheticall ceremoniall Law of faith, in the promiſe of the bleſſed ſeed, did continue from the very period of the promiſe, firſt made to Adam, (the redeemed head of man) till the day of our Saviours reſurrection from the grave, whereby the promiſed reſt of the bleſſed ſeed, was totally and abſolutely fulfilled. The continuation whereof may be divided in theſe two points: The firſt is the formall obligement of our Fathers by the promiſe, before any part of the promiſe was fulfilled. And this formall obligement did continue till our Saviours coming in the world, by whom the promiſe was fulfilled by degrees, which is to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:49359:61"/> in the third Book: As for the continuation of the formall obligement of the Law, obliging Adam and the Fathers in the promiſe; it may be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed in the firſt three ages of the Church.</p>
               <p>The firſt was from Adam to Noah: the ſecond from Noah to Abraham: the third from Abraham to Moſes, which continued till our Saviours com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; wherein my purpoſe is only to ſhew, that the formall obligement of the propheticall ceremoniall Law, by faith in the promiſe of the bleſſed ſeed; and that the covenant was really one and the ſame in all the firſt three ages of the Church, though the figures prefigurating the promiſe were more ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant, the more neer that the promiſe came to be fulfilled. After the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant (in the promiſe of the bleſſed ſeed) was entred with Adam, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed head of man, and with all men naturally to deſcend of Adam: Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, that old raging Lion, fearing the breaking of his head by the promiſed bleſſed ſeed to be born of the woman, did begin to roare afreſh, intending to devoure the line whereof the bleſſed ſeed was to deſcend, as he had devoured all men formally, by the betraying of our firſt parents to fall under the curſe of the Law by eternall death: For, Satan knowing the ſeverity of Gods juſtice, (whereof himſelf had ſuch experience) reſolved to ſet the whole world in ſuch a fire of ſin, as that God in his juſtice ſhould conſume all men off the earth again; and Satan put fairly for it: For, after by his ſting of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity (baited by his falſe deceiving light,) he had incenſed Cain to murder his Innocent brother Abel: Satan never left ſtirring up of Cains ungracious generation from time to time; till be ſet the whole world in ſuch a fire of ſin, cruelty, and uncleanneſſe, as neither the mercies of God, (by ſparing them ſo long) or the judgements of God threatned by his Prophets, could reclaim from their ſin and cruelty. God therefore in end, ſtirred up Noah, the tenth from Seth, a Preacher of Righteouſneſſe; who was a Preacher of the Law of righteouſneſſe of faith, in the promiſe of the bleſſed ſeed; that by his preaching of the Word, the miſerable people might be reclaimed from their cruelty and uncleanneſſe to the works of faith by repentance, that they might obtain mercy in the promiſe of the bleſſed ſeed; and that by denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the mercileſſe curſe of the Law of faith, Noah might terrifie the people from their wickeneſſe. But though Noah did continue in the faithfull diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of his Calling many yeeres; yet all was to no purpoſe, Satan had ſo incenſed the miſerable people to ſuch obſtinacy. God therefore in end, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded Noah to build an Ark, that by the ark Noah might denounce the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſubverſion of the obſtinate rebellious people, by the flood of his incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed wrath againſt their ſin and cruelty, if they did not ſpeedily turn to the Lord, and leave their provoking of his long patience: For which cauſe the
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:49359:61"/> Ark was ſo long a building, that the wretched people (notwithſtanding of their continued contempt,) might have yet time to repent, though all was to no purpoſe; for ſuch was the incenſed obſtinacy of the miſerable people, as they continued in their rebellious contempt, both of the word of the Preacher, and of the Ark, till the very day that Noah and his family was commanded to enter in the Ark, whereby the wrath of God was ſo incenſed, as by that fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full inundation, the whole earth was overflowne, and eight perſons only ſaved, of whom the promiſed bleſſed ſeed was to deſcend.</p>
               <p>As for the Covenant which is ſaid to be made with Noah (after his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of the Ark in the continuation of times and ſeaſons, and of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures created and redeemed for man) it was the ſame reall covenant which was formerly made with Adam, in the promiſe of the bleſſed ſeed, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this fearfull judgement, was renewed to Noah, for the ſtrengthening and confirming of Noahs faith, in the continuation of the promiſe firſt made to Adam: For, firſt, after Noahs coming out of the Ark, Noah did offer the like reall burnt ſacrifices and offerings upon the Atar of ſuch reall clean beaſts and fowles as were firſt commanded to be offred by Adam, and the Fathers before Noah; which beaſts and fowles were preſerved in the Ark with Noah; by which ſacrifices offered by Noah, the cruell death of the bleſſed ſeed was prefigurate.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the Ark it ſelf did prefigurate both the promiſe, and the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of the promiſe: For, firſt, by the Ark, the woman, of whoſe ſeed the Word was to be made fleſh, was prefigurate: Secondly, by Noah, and his ſons &amp; daughters (who was the eight from Seth) the line wherof the promiſed bleſſed ſeed was to deſcend, was prefigurate: Thirdly, by their receiving in the Ark; the conception of the Word to be made fleſh of the ſeed of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man was cleerly prefigurate: Fourthly, by the ſafe delivery of Noah, and his ſons and daughters out of the Ark, the ſafe delivery of the bleſſed ſeed by the woman, to wit, the bleſſed Virgine, was prefigurate; whereby it doth mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly appear, that the covenant, and the formall propheticall ceremoniall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligement of the Law of Righteouſneſſe of faith, in the promiſe of the bleſſed ſeed, propheſied by the propheticall Sabbath, and prefigurate by the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall worſhip of the Sabbath, was really one and the ſame, from Adam to Noah: As by the preſervation of Noah and his family; (of whom the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſeed was to deſcend, according to the fleſh) the great power of God by his preſervation of his Church, againſt the great power of Satan and his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments doth manifeſtly appear to his great glory, to the utter ſhame of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, and to the confuſion of his wicked inſtruments. And ſo much briefly for the firſt age of the Church.</p>

               <head type="sub">The continuation of the formall propheticall ceremoniall obligement of man in the promiſe of the bleſſed ſeed, in the ſecond age of the Church.</head>
               <p>AS in the time of Noah, the eighth from Seth; God ſtirred up Noah, to manifeſt his power in the preſervation of his Church, which did then conſiſt in the preſervation of the line of the bleſſed ſeed: So in the ſecond age of the Church, God raiſed up Abraham, (the tenth from Noah) that his glory might appear by his continuall care of the truth of his promiſe to his Church: For God renewed his promiſe in a more cleer and particular man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to Abraham then he did firſt to Adam; which was, that in Abrahams ſeed all the nations of the earth ſhould be bleſſed; that is, that the woman of whoſe ſeed the Word ſhould be made man, ſhould deſcend of Abrahams ſeed, by whoſe promiſed curſed death: As all men were then actually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed from the curſe of the Law for the ſin of Adam (though the promiſe was afterward to be fulfilled:) ſo all men by faith in this promiſe might be ſaved from the curſe of the Law of faith for actuall ſin.</p>
               <p>In this promiſe therefore, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22.18. that in Abrahams ſeed all the nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the earth ſhould be bleſſed, God doth oblige himſelf to Abraham and to his ſeed by covenant, and doth mutually oblige Abraham to believe his promiſe. This covenant therefore made to Abraham was the ſame reall co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant and promiſe made to Adam, though the bleſſed ſeed promiſed to Adam was by this promiſe to deſcend of Abrahams ſeed, the only difference is; that the woman of whom the Word was promiſed to be made man, was to deſcend immediately of Abrahams ſeed, though immediatly from Adams ſeed: For Abraham did deſcend of the ſeed of Adam, and conſequently the promiſe made to Abraham muſt be performed before the promiſe made to Adam could be fulfilled: For, the promiſe made to Adam could not be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed, but by our Saviours birth, death, and reſurrection from the dead. By this promiſe made in this particular manner to Abraham, the Church of God was now in the family of Abraham and his ſeed, and poſterity. To the end therefore, that Abrahams family might be diſtinguiſhed from all the families of the earth, God commanded Abraham and his family to be marked with the ſacramentall ſeal of circumciſion, by ſhedding of the blood of man; whereby it was prefigurate that the blood of the promiſed bleſſed ſeed, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend of Abraham (according to the fleſh) ſhould be ſhed by the curſed death of the croſſe, which was formerly prefigurate to Adam and the Fathers by the ſhedding of the blood of ſenſitive beaſts and fowles. And therefore the
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:49359:62"/> figure of the promiſed bleſſed ſeeed, by the ſacrament of circumciſion was more ſignificant then all the former bloody figures by the ſacrifice of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar. By the ſacrament of circumciſion therefore, Abrahams family was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed and divided, from all the families of the earth, till they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>united by the fulfilling of the promiſe by the new covenant: For, by the new covenant, all the families of the earth were called, and united in one Church and family: For the ſtrengthening of Abrahams faith in this graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous promiſe; the inheritance of the Land of Canaan was promiſed to Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham and to his ſeed; whereby it was prefigurate, that Abraham and his ſeed (by faith in the promiſe made to Abraham,) ſhould be inheritors of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Canaan, the Kingdome of heaven. The Church of God therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eſtabliſhed in the family of Abraham, and of his poſterity; the protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Church, and the preſervation of the line of the promiſed bleſſed ſeed, was committed to Abraham; to this end, God did enable Abraham with the power of wiſdome, valour, and with ſuch an admirable gift of ſpirituall faith, as Abraham is ſtyled in the Scripture, the Father of the faithfull. And though I muſt paſſe over the Hiſtory of Abrahams continuall victories over the enemies of the Church, and leave the Reader to inform himſelf by the ſacred Hiſtory; yet I cannot omit four memorable points of Abrahams faith, whereby he is moſt juſtly called the Father of the faithfull. The firſt was, though Abraham was above an hundred yeers old (when this promiſe was made;) and Sara was old and barren, and both, as it were, dead (by the courſe of nature) and paſt all ſuch hope; yet faithfull Abraham conſidered not the deadneſſe of his own body, or the deadneſſe of Sara's womb, but ſtedfaſtly believed the promiſe againſt all naturall hope, in hope that God, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his gracious wood would perform his promiſe. Secondly, Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams faith did wonderfully appear to his obedience to the command of God by his Word, <hi>Gen.</hi> 12.1. commanding Abraham to depart from his native ſoil, and to leave his kindred, friends, and poſſeſſions, where he was ſeated in ſuch plenty, and to go into a ſtrange countrey, inhabited with the power of ſuch mighty men, who were every way unknown to Abraham, and where he had no earthly help to truſt unto, but did, (as it were) expoſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and his family, to be made a prey unto ſtrangers; yet faithfull Abraham ſetting all doubts, fears, kindred, friends, pleaſures and poſſeſſions aſide, did give obedience to the command of God, and marched boldly to the Land of Canaan. Thirdly, how admirably doth our Saviour commend Abrahams faith, while as our Saviour told the Jews, ſaying, <hi>John</hi> 8.56. <hi>Abraham did ſee my day, and was glad, and rejoyced therein:</hi> For, Abraham, with the eyes of his ſpirituall faith, did ſee the Lords day, in the eighth day of the Sacrament
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:49359:63"/> of circumciſion; for the child was circumciſed upon the eighth day, though the eighth day of the circumciſion fell out upon the ſeventh day of the great propheticall Sabbath, which was commanded long before the Sacrament of circumciſion; and ſo preciſely commanded as no mann<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r of work was to be done upon the ſeventh day of the propheticall Sabbath, much leſſe the ſhedding of the blood of man: for, the only commanded works of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheticall ceremoniall worſhip of God were to be done upon the Sabbath; Abraham therefore obſerving with the ſpirituall eyes of faith, that the ſeventh day of the propheticall Sabbath did give place to the adminiſtration of the Sacrament of circumciſion: Abraham did apprehend, that the eighth day ſhould be worſhipped in place of the ſeventh day of the propheticall Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath. The reaſon was, becauſe the Sacrament of circumciſion did prefigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate both Chriſts death, and the day of his reſurrection from the dead; for as by the ſhedding of the childs blood, the ſhedding of the bleſſed childs blood by the curſed death of the croſſe was prefigurate: So by the ſtenching of the childs blood, upon the eighth day (whereby the life of the child was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved) the day of our Saviours reſurrection from the dead was prefigurate, to wit, the Lords day, which was the eighth day from the laſt Jews prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall Sabbath; for the laſt Sabbath whereon our Saviour did reſt in the grave, was no wayes the Jews propheticall Sabbath; neither was there any Jew or Gentile bound or obliged to fulfill the command of the ſeventh day of the laſt Sabbath: For, all men naturally deſcended of Adam the redeemed head of man were only obliged to the command of the ſeventh day of the propheticall Sabbath, which did propheſie our Saviours reſt in the grave, by whoſe reſt in the grave all the propheſies propheſied by the propheticall Sabbath were fulfilled. The laſt Sabbath therefore, whereon our Saviour did reſt in his ſacred grave was no wayes propheticall, neither was there any man naturally deſcended of Adam obliged to fulfill the command of the laſt Sabbath. Let us therefore leave the laſt Sabbath to the Lord of the Sabbath, and adde ſeven dayes more to the laſt Jews formall propheticall Sabbath; and we have the Lords day (the day of his reſurrection from the grave) to be the juſt eighth day, as the Lords day was prefigurate to Abraham by the eighth day of the circumciſion: But let us account the number of dayes from the laſt formall Jews propheticall Sabbath, and begin the accompt at the firſt day of the week, according to the Jews computation of the dayes of their Sabbaticall week, as both Jews and Gentiles were obliged to the Law of God; and the Lords day is the juſt ſeventh day from the laſt formall Jews propheticall Sabbath, and the true ſeventh day of the Evangelicall Law of faith, more ſatisfactory to be declared hereafter. What an admirable
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:49359:63"/> faith was this in Abraham to ſee the Lords day ſo far off, as it was prefigurate by the Sacrament of circumciſion? though the Lords day be the true ſeventh day of the Evangelicall Law of faith, as all men naturally deſcended of Adam are obliged to the command of the ſeventh day of the Law; for without the command of the ſeventh day of the Law, there is no Law to command man. The fourth memorable point, wherein the excellency of Abrahams faith did appear, was in Abrahams readineſſe at the command of God, to offer up in ſacrifice his ſon Iſaac, his only hope, and heir of the promiſe, and his only comfort next to God: For, it may juſtly amaze the heart of a naturall man, that Abraham, againſt nature, (by forgetting of all naturall affection) ſhould be ſo forward to attempt ſuch cruelty with his own bloody hands, to cut the throat of his ſo dearly beloved childe, the only hope and heir of the promiſe. Though this command was out of the infinite love of God to Abraham; for God did never intend that Abraham ſhould commit any ſuch cruelty: But that Abraham, and all men of the faith of Abraham, might underſtand, that God ſpared not his only Son, (the Son of his love) to ſacrifice him (as it were) with his own hands, for his love which he doth bear to man: For, all the created powers of God were not able to bereave our Saviour of his life, without his own gracious permiſſion, who out of his infinite love and mercy to man, did moſt lovingly and mercifully lay down his life for man.</p>
               <p>Here the queſtion may be moved: Was the Church of God upon earth then, only in Abrahams family, and his poſterity, and no where elſe?</p>
               <p>I anſwer: As the Lord Jeſus Chriſt is the head of all his redeemed mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, the Lord from the beginning had his univerſall Church through all the Nations of the earth, though his particular Church, according to his promiſe, was then in Abraham, and in the poſterity of Abraham for the time. And therefore, though the Apoſtle did tell the Gentiles that they were not of the circumciſion, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.12. but aliens from the common wealth of Iſrael, and, as it were, without any Chriſt, and conſequently without God; For, Chriſt, according to the fleſh, was to deſcend of the circumciſed; yet the Gentiles had the propheticall Sabbath, and the altar and ſacrifice, as it was preſcribed to Adam, and the Fathers before the promiſe was made to Abraham, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, the covenant and formall obligement of the Law, really one from the beginning. And the Apoſtle doth acknowledge, that the Gentiles did do the things contained in the Law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.14. which was the ceremoniall works of the Law, though the Gentiles did them not in that preciſe manner as they were done by the Jews. And through the Apoſtle ſaith, that the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles did do the things contained in the Law by the light of their conſcience; yet that light was the light of the redeemed word of the Law of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:49359:64"/> of faith written in their heart, which was really one with the light of the ſeventh day of the propheticall Sabbath, and with the ceremoniall light of the altar &amp; ſacrifice, whereby they were inabled to do the things contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Law. And who ſhould bar the free Spirit of God to blow where it liſteth, <hi>John</hi> 3.8. and to enlighten many of the Gentiles? Did not the Lord commend the Centurions faith, and ſay, <hi>Luke</hi> 7.9. that he did not finde ſuch faith in Iſrael? And how greatly did our Saviour commend the faith of the Canaanitiſh woman, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.28. and the faith of one of the ten Lepers, and <hi>Luke</hi> 17.19. yet the promiſe made to Abraham was not then fulfilled. And did not Chriſt himſelf him, according to the fleſh, deſcend of the Gentiles, though immediately of the ſeed of Abraham? Let no man therefore think, but that the Lord had his univerſall Church in all ages, though his particular Church was then in the family and poſterity of Abraham. And ſo much for the ſecond age of the Church, and for the reall unity of the covenant and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall obligement of the Law, as the promiſe was made to Abraham, which was really one with the covenant made with Adam.</p>

               <head type="sub">The continuation of the formall propheticall ceremoniall obligement of the Law, in the third age of the Church.</head>
               <p>THe third age of the Church from the beginning, was in the time of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, deſcended of Abraham, whom God raiſed for the preſervation of his Church, then in the poſterity of Abraham, whoſe poſterity the Lord (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his eternall purpoſe) would not permit to be eſtabliſhed in the Land of Canaan, for the ſpace of forty yeers, to the end that God by the Miniſtry of his ſervant Moſes, might manifeſt the glory of his power in the protection of his Church againſt the great power of Satan, and of his migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty inſtruments; for which cauſe God inabled Moſes with the power of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, valour, and faith, amongſt the number of whoſe memorable acts, I will only touch three; leaving the reſt to the Reader to be informed by the ſacred Hiſtory; my purpoſe being only to ſhew, that the covenant, and the formall obligement of the Law, was really one and the ſame from the beginning, as it was made to Adam and to Abraham.</p>
               <p>The firſt memorable act of Moſes Miniſtry, was in the delivery of the people from the Egyptian ſervitude, who were the ſeed of Abraham, of whom the promiſed bleſſed ſeed, according to the fleſh, was to deſcend; and were then miſerably oppreſſed under the tyrannous hand of great King Pharoah the proud Egyptian King, ſtirred up to that cruelty by the inſtigati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:49359:64"/> of Satan, and of his wicked ſeed: For, whoſe delivery God raiſed up his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant Moſes. To this end, firſt, God ſent Moſes to King Pharoah, commanding King Pharoah, that he would permit the people of Iſrael to depart from the Land of Egypt; but God (according to his eternall decree) did harden the heart of Pharoah, that he ſhould not let the people of Iſrael depart from Egypt, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till ſuch time as God ſhould make his continuall care appear in the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Church, againſt the great power of Satan and the power of his mighty inſtruments in this life. And therefore, upon Pharoahs rebellious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining of the people of Iſrael from time to time, contrary to the Lords com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; God by the Miniſtry of his ſervant Moſes, from time to time did plague the proud Egyptian King and his kingdome; and though plague after plague was with ſuch fearfull miraculous and wonderfull judgements, as did aſtoniſh the hearts of the whole world; ye ſuch was the obſtinacy of Pharoahs rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious heart ſtirred up by the inchantments of his Sorcerers (whoſe power God did of purpoſe permit:) as Pharoah did reſiſt the command of God, with ſuch a high hand, thirſting after the deſtruction of the Church till Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roah with his great army was overwhelmed in the red ſea of Gods raging wrath; which mighty act was done by the Miniſtry of Moſes, by ſtretching out his hand upon the red ſea at the command of God. By this miraculous overthrow of the Egyptians, the mighty deliverance of the Church of God from the Egyptian ſervitude was wrought to the amanement of the world, to the end that the Church of God in future ages might never diſtruſt the Lords continuall care in the preſervation of his Church againſt the power of Satan, and againſt the power of his mightieſt inſtruments upon earth. In that night of the fearfull Egyptian plague of the born, the ſacrament of the Paſſeover was inſtitute by God, to remain in the Church, with the ſacrament of circumciſion, during the formall propheticall ceremoniall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligement of the Law, by which ceremoniall ſacrament of the Paſſeover, the promiſe of the bleſſed was more ſignificantly prefigurate, then for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly: For, firſt, by the ſacrifice of the Paſchal Lamb, which was command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be eaten: the Lamb of God (the promiſed bleſſed ſeed) was ſignified, who was to be ſacrificed for the ſins of man. Secondly, by the bitter herbs, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.8. with which the fleſh of the Lamb was commanded to be eaten; the bitter currſe of the wrath of God, againſt the Lamb, who made himſelf a curſe for man, was myſtically ſignified. Thirdly, by the anointing of the door poſts with the blood of the Lamb, that the deſtroying Angel might paſſe over the Iſraelites houſes, whereby they were ſaved from the plague, was myſtically ſignified, that by faith in the merit of the blood of the Lamb of God (the promiſed bleſſed ſeed,) they were ſaved from the plague and curſe
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:49359:65"/> of the ſecond death (which is for actuall ſin,) as by the promiſed curſed death of the Lamb, they were ſaved from the firſt death, which was the curſe of the Law for the ſin of Adam.</p>
               <p>The ſecond memorable act of Moſes Miniſtrie was, firſt, in the ſanctifying and aſſembling of the people of Iſrael at the command of God to hear the word of the Law commanded by God himſelf immediatly, which was in a moſt majeſticall, glorious manner delivered by God unto the people of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, in ten diſtinct ſeverall precepts. The delivery whereof was with ſuch fearfull thundring and lightning, and with the ſound of trumpet, as the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain was exceedingly ſhaken, all to ſignifie the power of the ſound of the word of the Law, commanding the obedience of man. By this glorious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery of the word of the Law, the people of Iſrael were ſtriken with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend fear and obedience to the command of God, though their fear of the voyce of God was ſuch, as they did intreat that Moſes might deliver to them what the Lord ſhould further command. Wherefore the morall Law being firſt commanded by God, God by the Miniſtry of Moſes, did next ſet down the civill Law between man and man, to the end that all men might under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that all the lawes between man and man, muſt be grounded upon the morall Law of God. As for the ceremoniall Law, it was the ſame which was before to the Fathers implyed in the ceremoniall altar and ſacrifice, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till ſuch time as at the erection of the Tabernacle, the ceremoniall Law was commanded after a more particular manner, to the people of Iſrael, though really one with the ceremoniall Law of the altar and ſacrifice, prefigurating the promiſe of the bleſſed ſeed. Secondly, the Lord afterward called Moſes up to the mount, to deliver to Moſes the two Tables of the Law, written by God in ſtone, which was formerly delivered by his Word, to the end, that by the Miniſtry of Moſes, his written Word might be delivered to the people of Iſrael, that the people might be inſtructed in the knowledge of the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Word; where one thing is to be obſerved, to wit, that Moſes by his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing with God in the mount for the ſpace of forty dayes and forty nights, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.29. the skin of Moſes face became ſo ſhining, as while Moſes was about to deliver the written Word of the Law, the people were not able to behold Moſes face; in ſo much that Moſes was fain to vail his face, while he ſpake to the people; by which ſhining light of Moſes face, the glorious light of the written Word was myſtically ſignified. As for Moſes zeal (moved at the people of Iſraels Idolatry,) in breaking of the Tables of the word of the Law, and the renewing of the Tables, and all ſuch memorable paſſages, I muſt leave the judicious Reader to inform himſelf by the written Word of the ſacred Hiſtory.</p>
               <pb n="121" facs="tcp:49359:65"/>
               <p>The third remarkable act of Moſes miniſtry, was the erection of the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle at the command of God, according to the pattern which God did ſhew and ſet down to Moſes, <hi>Exod.</hi> 25.40. while he was with God in the mount; which of all the types, figures, and ceremonies, prefigurating the promiſe of the bleſſed ſeed to all the Fathers of the former ages, was moſt cleer and ſignificant: For, by the Tabernacle and Temple (which were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally one, which the Lord calleth his body) the fulfilling of the promiſe, both made to Abraham, and to Adam, were plainly prefigurate: For, firſt, by the types and figures of the firſt Tabernacle, called the Holy Place; as by the golden Altar, by the table of Shew-bread, <hi>Exod.</hi> 39.38. by the golden Candleſticks, by the brazen Altar and Laver before the porch, which did appertain to the ſervice of the Holy place of the Tabernacle; by which cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall Rites and Ceremonies, the high Leviticall Prieſt was to diſcharge the ſervice of the Holy place, whereby the fulfilling of the promiſe made to Abraham was prefigurate: For, as the Leviticall high Prieſt (who was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended of Abraham) was the figure of the high Prieſt, after the order of Melchiſedeck (to wit, the promiſed bleſſed ſeed deſcended likewiſe of the ſeed of Abraham;) ſo, by the diſcharging of the Leviticall high Prieſts of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, the execution of the high Prieſts office, after the order of Melchiſedeck, was prefigurate: For, firſt, as the Leviticall high Prieſt did offer up the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remoniall ſacrifice of the hard brazen altar: So the hard curſed ſacrifice of the high Prieſt, after the order of Melchiſedeck was offered upon the curſed altar of the croſſe, who made himſelf a curſe for man. Secondly, as by the Leviticall high Prieſt, after the offering up of the ſacrifice of the brazen al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, <hi>Exod.</hi> 30.19, 20, 21. did waſh his hands and feet before he entred the holy place of the Temple: So after the offering of the curſed ſacrifice of the croſſe, the high Prieſt, after the order of Melchiſedeck, did waſh the curſed bloody wounds of his hands and feet, and waſh all men for whom he made himſelf a curſe, before he entred the Tabernacle not made with hands. Thirdly, as the Leviticall high Prieſt by his entring into the holy Place of the Temple, did offer ſweet incenſe at the golden Altar, whereby God was ſaid to ſmell a ſavour of reſt: So the high Prieſt, after the order of Melchiſedeck, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 9.24. did enter the Tabernacle not made with hands, by his ſweet pleaſing ſacrifice, to make eternall peace between God and man for the ſin of Adam, and to make continuall interceſſion for the actuall ſins of his myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call members, at the altar of Righteouſneſſe of faith; by the pleaſing ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of whoſe bloody ſacrifice the wrath of God is eternally appeaſed for the actuall ſins of his myſticall members, whereby they reſt freed from the curſe of the ſecond death in this life, and ſhall reſt eternally in their
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:49359:66"/> myſticall head in all glory and happineſſe in the life. By this means, the promiſe of the bleſſed ſeed made to Abraham was fulfilled: Our Saviour, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the promiſe made to Abraham, did deſcend of Abrahams ſeed; for he was born man of the ſeed of the bleſſed Virgine, lineally deſcended of Abrahams ſeed, and lived man upon the earth, and in the end was moſt cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elly crucified for man. At the expiration of whoſe laſt breath, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27.51. the great vail of the Temple was rent, from the top to the bottome; that by this great rent, it might be known to all the world, that the benefit and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of his curſed death did belong to Adam, and to all men naturally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended, and to deſcend of Adam to the end of the world, according to the promiſe made to Adam. And therefore, upon the day of his reſurrection from the grave, both the Jews and Gentiles were graciouſly called, to whoſe faith, the bleſſing of the promiſe made to Abraham, was freely offered by the new covenant; by means whereof, the promiſe made to Abraham, that in his ſeed, all the nations of the earth ſhould be bleſſed, was graciouſly and faithfully fulfilled. And this is the reaſon, that the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.8. that while the firſt Tabernacle was ſtanding, the ſecond Tabernacle could not be opned; for all the nations of the world could not be bleſſed in this promiſe, till our Saviour did firſt ſuffer; though his ſuffering was firſt and immediately for the Jews, which was prefigurate by the Levitical high Prieſts breſt-plate, <hi>Exod.</hi> 39.8.14 wherein the names of the twelve Tribes of Iſrael were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, while he was to offer up the ſacrifice of the altar; whereby it was ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, that our Saviour was firſt and immediatly to be offered in ſacrifice for the Jews; and therefore it is ſaid, <hi>John</hi> 4.22. that, <hi>Salvation is from the Jews.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus have we briefly declared, that (in the three firſt ages of the Church) the formall propheticall ceremoniall Law was really one and the ſame, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging of the Fathers, before any part of the promiſe of the bleſſed ſeed was fulfilled: So by the Tabernacle and Temple (which our Saviour calls his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy) whereby both the promiſe made to Abraham, and the promiſe made to Adam were prefigurate, it was ſignified, that the ſame formall obligement of the Law, did continue from Moſes till our Saviours coming in the world, and from his coming, till the day of his reſurrection from the grave, which is to be declared in the third Book of our Theologicall key; in the mean time, for a concluſion to this ſecond Book, certain materiall objections are to be anſwered againſt the perfection of the redemption of man, which doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern both that which hath been delivered in this ſecond Book, and likewiſe, that which is to be delivered in the third.</p>

               <head type="sub">Satans cunning by his tempting of man by the ſenſitive naturall object of his underſtanding.</head>
               <p>FIrſt, it is objected: Satan hath the power to unite the free love of man ſo inſeparably to the ſenſitive object of his pleaſure, as man doth neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily produce his action contrary to the Law of faith. Satan therefore hath the power to neceſſitate the free will of man to diſobedience, contrary to the declaration of the perfection of redemption.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, The inference is fallacious: For, though Satan hath the power (by his falſe envious deceiving light) to unite to the love and deſire of man to the object of his ſenſitive pleaſure; yet it is by the free act of the love of man, that man is induced to that union, and not by Satans neceſſitating of his will: I cleer the point by Satans cunning in tempting of man. Satan doth tempt man to diſobedience, both by the naturall and morall object of the underſtanding of man: Firſt, of Satans cunning in tempting of man by the naturall object; and next, of his cunning in tempting man by the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall object of his underſtanding. By the naturall externall ſenſitive object of mans underſtanding; I underſtand all things in nature, whereby the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and will of man is produced in act, by the mediate ſenſes; all which things are the proper objects of the five externall ſenſes of man. Theſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall ſenſitive objects, Satan by himſelf and his inſtruments, doth ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually and actually enlighten, with his falſe envious deceiving naturall light, as the ſpecies of theſe ſenſitive objects, (thus Satanically enlightened) being received in the underſtanding, the love of man is ſo incenſed, to unite it ſelf to the object of its pleaſure, as it doth hate all things that doth reſiſt the union by which miſerable union theſe fearfull effects are produced.</p>
               <p>Firſt, by this foul incenſed love and deſire of man, to apprehend the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ive object of his pleaſure, ſlaming in the heart of man; the light of the redeemed word of the Law written in the heart, is ſo obſcured and darkned, as wretched man doth greedily graſp the ſenſitive object, without all reſpect to the Law of faith; and this is the firſt degree of actuall ſin, which is by the darkning and obſcuring of the word of the ſeventh dayes reſt of the Law of Righteouſneſſe of faith, whereby the works of faith are formally comm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: for the light of the word of the Law in the heart (which is really one with the light of the word of the ſeventh dayes reſt of the Law of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of faith) being obſcured, the light of the word of the ſeventh dayes reſt is neceſſarily obſcured and darkned. And therefore this falſe envious deceiving light of Satan, is called the Devils darkneſſe, and the works
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:49359:67"/> produced by this falſe deceiving light, are called the works of darkneſſe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the incenſed naturall love and pleaſure of man, and the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive object of his pleaſure being once actually united; ſuch continuall fewell is added to this incenſed fire, (by Satan and his inſtruments) as wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched man doth lie and continue in his filthy love and pleaſure, and hate all things which doth reſiſt the enjoying of his foul deſire: And this is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that the Lord ſaith, <hi>John</hi> 3.20. he that doth evill, doth hate the light; which is the light of the command of the Law of faith: For, by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Law of faith, all ſuch continued filthy pleaſure is condemned. And this is the ſecond degree of actuall ſin, which is by continuance in ſin.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, by this falſe envious deceiving light of Satan, whereby the love and deſire of man, and the object of his pleaſure are ſo united; the more that wretched man is preſſed with the command of the Law, the more ſtrictly doth he unite himſelf to the object of his pleaſure, by reſiſting all command of the Law, and the preſſure of the command: And this <hi>Medea</hi> could ſee, while, as ſhe ſaith, we preſſe againſt what is forbidden, and ſtill affect what is denied. And this the third degree of actuall ſin, while by the continuance of man in actuall ſin, the long patience of God (leading him ſo graciouſly to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,) is contemned with ſuch a high hand; as God doth juſtly give him over to ſuch a reprobate minde as he cannot repent, though he hath all the dayes of his life to repent: For, by this means, that morall power of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, which wretched man hath by the redeemed word of the Law, and life of Righteouſneſſe of faith, written in his heart, is taken away; and this is the reaſon that it is ſaid, <hi>Luke</hi> 19.26. from him that hath not, that which he hath ſhall be taken away; that is to ſay, becauſe wretched man will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent (having morall grace to repent;) therefore he ſhall be deprived of the power of morall grace to repent. For the better conceiving of this point two queſtions are to be anſwered:</p>
               <p>The firſt is; wherein ſtands Satans cunning, that he thus betrayes man to lie and continue in the pleaſure of ſin. I anſwer: Satans cunning ſtandeth in this; that by his falſe deceiving envious light, the free act of the naturall love and pleaſure of man, to apprehend the object of his pleaſure, is extended to the pleaſure of pride; that is to ſay, by Satans falſe deceiving envious light, the formall naturall act of the will (which worketh by love, and is natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly good) is ſtrained and extended to the formall morall evill act of the will, and to the height of pride by continuance in actuall ſin: For, all continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in actuall ſin, is originally from pride, and pride from the devils darknes. And this is the reaſon that actuall ſin is called Idolatry; for pride in the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of ſin, is the Idol of the heart, reſiſting all command of the Law of faith.
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:49359:67"/> To make this appear by one example which ſhall ſerve for all; It is in the free act of the naturall will of man (which works by the love of man to the ſenſitive object of his pleaſure,) to drink a cup of wine (ſometimes) for his health; but while his love and deſire to wine (by Satans falſe deceiving en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious light,) is ſo continued, as he hateth all company, but only ſuch as love that which he loveth: For, in this union ſtandeth the pleaſure of ſin, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe by this multiplied union, the ſtrength of the pleaſure of ſin is multiplied and extended to ſuch a height, as it doth reſiſt all power of command of the Law: For, the drunkard out of his pride, hates all light which is averſe to his filthy pleaſure. And this is the old Serpents ſting of enmity, whereby he ſtings wretched man, to ſuch a height of unlawfull pleaſure, which doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get ſin upon ſin, as by daily experience is ſeen in the drunkard. And this is the Devils cunning in all actuall ſin whatſoever; for by his falſe deceiving envious light; he doth incenſe the good naturall act of the concupiſcence of man, to the pleaſure of pride, which is Idolatry, and in this only ſenſe the act of the concupiſcence, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.10. is ſaid to be the root of all evill, which is otherwiſe good by nature.</p>
               <p>The ſecond queſtion may be moved, Doth Satan by his falſe envious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving light, thus enlighten all the ſeverall ſenſitive objects of the naturall love and pleaſure of man? this were an endleſſe work for Satan</p>
               <p>I anſwer, Satan, either by his own immediate ſuggeſtion, by enlighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſpecies of ſome former ſenſitive object in the phanſie; or by the help of his inſtruments, doth actually enlighten all the ſeverall externall ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive objects of the naturall love and pleaſure of man, by his falſe envious deceiving light; and theſe inſtruments be ſuch, as Satan (by the ſowing of his curſed ſeed of enmity, baited by his falſe lying deceiving naturall light) hath begotten his children, in a manner, from the cradle, who by their ſo often ſwallowing of the pleaſing bait, are become as cunning and expert in the faculty of tempting, as Satan himſelf; in ſo much, that there is not that ſeverall naturall pleaſure, proceeding from the love of man to the exernall ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive object, which is not incenſed by ſome or other of Satans inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, who ſwarm ſo in all places, as an honeſt Chriſtian hath much ado to avoid the danger of their cunning; ſuch is their audacious officiouſneſſe, to invite the naturall love and pleaſure of man to ſin and miſchief. And theſe are the old roaring Lions welps, and the falſe deceiving lights of the Devils lanthorn, that leads the hopefull youth of this Kingdome from one conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming place of filthy pleaſure to another, till their hearts are ſo incenſed with the pride of pleaſure, as all is ſo ſpent and conſumed, that (for the moſt part) the poor wretches are neceſſitate to ſuch wants, as (without the preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:49359:68"/> mercy of God) they muſt either ſtarve, or take ſome ſuch deſperate courſe to ſupply their wants, as they are brought to a ſhamefull end; to the ſhamefull ſcandall of the Church of God, while under the Law of Grace, the hopefull plants of his Church, are by this miſerable means brought to deſpair of all Grace. What hard hearted Chriſtian is not ſenſible of this miſery? But all are at their wits end, how to remove the cauſe of the miſery, ſuch is the helliſh power of this curſed brood. Let the morall power therefore of the ſlaming ſword of the Word, be put in the right hand, and neither the Devill or his inſtruments ſhall have ſuch domineering power: For, by the ſlaming light of the Word, the moſt rebellious roaring rakeſhame, is either confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to the command of the Law of faith; or by the ſtroke of the ſword cut off, from being ſuch a foul ſcandall to the Church; and without repentance and ſubmiſſion, baniſhed the Kingdome: So by this means, ſuch wilde Boars of the forreſt, ſhall not have ſuch power to root up the hopefull plants of the Lords Vineyard; and as for ſuch plants as theſe wilde Boars did ſo la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to root up out of the Lords Vineyard, and are brought to ſuch a low ebbe, let never their caſe ſeem deſperate, either to themſelves or to us, while as they are ſenſible of the ſhame that they are brought unto, by the pride of ſin for ſhame, for the the pride of ſin, is the firſt grace that the Lord doth confer upon thoſe whom he hath predeſtinate, to be made like to the Image of his Son; for ſuch the Lord doth enable with patience to indure his hand till they be throughly humbled for their pride, and then they are fitted for the grace of ſpirituall preferment: For, God doth give his ſpirituall grace to the humble, but he doth reſiſt the proud; and therefore it is ſaid, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 40.4. every valley ſhall be exalted, and every high mountain (which is the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of pride) ſhall be brought low; for the Lord never leaves his own, till (by their humiliation) they be brought ſo low, as they are fitted with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, to wait upon his prefixed time for their ſpirituall calling; that by the grace of his ſpirituall light, that they may be led by the hands of faith, to lay ſuch faſt hold on the Lords merit, as all their actuall ſins are covered, which was the cauſe of their ſhame and afflictions: And that by the power of his merit; that as the Lord hath removed the cauſe of their ſhame, ſo he is able, even in this life, to raiſe and exalt them from the greateſt affliction: or, if (for the continuance of their obedience) they are not totally freed in this life, yet their comfort is, that their greateſt ſcarlet ſins ſhall never have power to condemn them; the reaſon is, becauſe their ſpirituall faith, and the Lords merit, are really and ſpiritually one, whereby they are juſtified by the Law, and who is he that dare condemn them? for it is the Lord that doth juſtifie them by his merit. And therefore, though it be the Lords pleaſure
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:49359:68"/> (for their triall) to keep them in ſome meaſure, under the yoak of affliction in this life, yet they are enabled with patience to bear his hand, till in his good time, he determine their afflictions, by calling them to himſelf, where they ſhall be exalted to an incorruptible crown of glory, and (in their myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call head) enabled to tread on the neck of the old roaring Serpent, and upon the neck of his curſed brood, to their eternall confuſion, for betraying them by the pride of ſin, to the ſhame and afflictions of this life. And now, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this point of Satans cunning, by this tempting of man by the naturall ſenſitive object: Of all the temptations of Satan, his accuſing of man, whom he hath betrayed to ſuch long continuance in actuall ſin, is the moſt fearfull. And from this fearfull accuſing of man, Satan is called the Devill, and in this diabolicall faculty ſtands the maſter-piece of the Devils cunning: For, when the Devill doth once begin to accuſe wretched man for his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance in unrepented ſin, the fearfull ſeverity of Gods juſtice (for the high contempt of the Law of faith, and the impoſſibility of his mercy to ſuch high continued contempt) is ſo continually ſuggeſted by Satan, as he never leaves, night and day, racking and torturing of the guilty conſcience of the wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched ſinner, till his ſpirit be ſo inſupportably wounded, as he is induced to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that all repentance comes too late, and to deſpair of all mercy; and unleſſe by the Lords unexpected concurſive grace, the fearfull blow be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, ſuch is the inſupportable wounded ſpirit of the wretched ſinner, by the Devils continuall accuſation; as the Devill doth eaſily induce the tortured reſtleſſe deſperate man, to lay violent hands on himſelf as a preſent remedy for his torture and pain. O that the wretched ſinner would in time (but by morall repentance) accuſe and condemn himſelf for his obſtinate continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in actuall ſin, as he is morally inabled thereto by the perfection of his redemption, and then he ſhall prevent the Devils cunning: For, by that happy means the Devils fearfull accuſation ſhould come too late; for there is alwayes ſuch mercy in ſtore to the leaſt repenting ſinner, as there is no place for the Devill to plead at the barre of the Lords mercy, and to accuſe man for actuall ſin. I next proceed to the declaration of Satans cunning in his betraying of man by the morall object of mans underſtanding.</p>

               <p>BY the morall object of mans underſtanding; I underſtand the word of the ſeventh dayes reſt, implying the command of the whole Law, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by man from the beginning, by every ſeverall covenant, is formally obliged
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:49359:69"/> to produce his action according to the formall command of the Law, as he is actually enabled to produce that formall action by the power of the Word of the Law and life of Righteouſneſſe, written in his heart. This light of the word of Law in the heart; Satan from the beginning, hath, and doth ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure, by a falſe deceiving morall light, contradictory to the light of the word of the ſeventh dayes reſt: By the obſcuring of which light of the word of the Law written in the heart, the light of the word of the ſeventh dayes reſt, is neceſſarily obſcured and darkned, by means whereof man doth produce his action without all reſpect to the formall command of the Law. By this falſe morall deceiving light, as Satan from the beginning did obſcure the light of the Law of God totally and in generall; ſo by his falſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving morall light, Satan doth now obſcure and darken the light of the Law of faith in particular, by his obtruding and ſuggeſting falſe fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall particular points of faith, whereby the Church of God hath been ſo mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerably diſtracted in all ages: So Satan, by his falſe deceiving morall light, did betray our firſt parents to tranſgreſſe the Law of God: For, while God by his firſt covenant had obliged man to fulfill the command of his Law, by his Word commanding man to abſtain from eating of the fruit of the tree of knowledge, upon the curſe of a dying death: Satan by the Serpent did ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt a falſe morall deceiving light, contradictory to the light of the command of God, which was, that by eating of the forbidden fruit, our firſt parents ſhould not only be freed from all fear of any dying death by covenant, but that by eating of the fruit, they ſhould be equall to God himſelf; by which falſe great ſuggeſted morall light, the hearts of our firſt parents was ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed to ſuch a height of pride, to be equall to God, as they did greedily graſp the fruit without all reſpect to the command of God by his Word, commanding man, which was the command of the word of the firſt ſeventh dayes reſt of the Law of Righteouſneſſe: For, by the foul incenſed deſire of our firſt parents to be equall to God, flaming in their hearts; the light of the Word in their hearts was obſcured and darkned, by obſcuring whereof, the light of the word of the firſt ſeventh dayes reſt was ſo totally obſcured and darkned, as the whole Law was tranſgreſſed, whereby Adam, the created head of man, and all men naturally to deſcend of the head, were condemned to the curſe of the Law of Righteouſneſſe by the firſt covenant: So after the ſecond covenant was made in the promiſe of the bleſſed ſeed by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed reſt of the propheticall Sabbath, and after the word, (the bleſſed ſeed) was born man, of the ſeed of the woman, and after he did manifeſt himſelf to the Jews by his glorious works, wonders, and miracles, that he was that promiſed bleſſed ſeed of the woman, and the eternall Son of God, by whom
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:49359:69"/> they were to enjoy the promiſed reſt of their propheticall Sabbath, extending his love and mercy ſo generally towards all, by curing of all ſenſitive diſeaſes incurable by nature, and the diſeaſes of the ſouls of many, whereby he did ſo ingage the reverend love and fear, of all, leading the world ſo by that glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous light, that happy was he that could but touch the Lord of Life. In ſo much, that the glory of his light was ſuch, as the Jews began to be poſſeſt with a jealouſie, that by this great glorious light, the glory of their great propheticall Sabbath ſhould be obſcured, whereby they were ſo famous above all nations, and that the honour and dignity of the Leviticall Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and the great preferment which they did hold by the Prieſthood ſhould be quite taken away from them. At this jealouſie of the Jews, the Devill takes occaſion to ſuggeſt a remedy for this fear, and that was, that they ſhould kill the Word which did ſo gloriouſly ſhine amongſt them; though this ſuggeſtion of Satan was but a cloak to colour his own fear, leſt the head of the Serpent ſhould be broke by the ſeed of the woman, which ſuggeſted remedy, the Jews did divers times attempt, but the Lord did prevent their purpoſe by eſcaping their bloody hands, becauſe his hour was not come; yet this fear did ſo poſſeſſe Satan, as he never left with all diligence, to watch his opportunity till the hour was come that our Saviour was to ſuffer for the ſins of man; for then Satan did beſtir himſelf, by incenſing of the high Prieſt, Scribes, Phariſees, and the rabblement of the Jews and Gentiles with moſt cruell bloody hands to murder the Lord of life, the Word, whereby the light of the whole Word was obſcured and darkned for a time. And then both Satan and the Jews thought themſelves ſecure. But after the Lords reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection from the dead, Satan apprehending himſelf ſo horribly deceived, the roaring Lyion did ſo rage, as he did incenſe the Jews to keep afoot the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remoniall worſhip of the Jews propheticall Sabbath, for which effect Satans inſtruments were ſet awork to perſecute the planters of the Evangell, amongſt w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

As Satan by his falſe morall light, did obſcure the light of the word of the ſeventh dayes reſt from the beginning totally and in generall: So doth he now by his falſe deceiving morall light, obſcure the Evangelicall light of
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:49359:70"/> the word of the ſeventh dayes reſt of the Law of Righteouſneſſe of faith in particular, which Satan doth effect by ſuggeſting a falſe morall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving light, contradictory to the light of the Evangelicall Law of faith, whereby ſome fundamentall points of faith is ſubverted, and ſtifly maintained, contrary to the Evangelicall Law of faith; ſome of which points be ancient, ſome modern, of the ancient ſubjected points of faith, ſuch are theſe: Firſt, ſalvation from the curſe of the Evangelicall Law of righteouſneſſe of faith may be merited by the good works of man. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, Chriſt died for originall ſin only. Thirdly, the actuall ſins of the dead and of the quick, are taken away by the ſurmiſed ſacrifice of the ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ceremoniall altar. Fourthly, the power to pardon actuall ſin, as it is a tranſgreſſion againſt the ſpirituall command of the Law, is in the Church. Fifthly, univerſality of ſpirituall grace, to fulfill the command of the Law, is by the act of the externall ſacrament of baptiſme. The authority of ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonicall Scripture depends upon the allowance of man, and a world of ſuch errors: So of modern fundamentall errors, be ſuch as theſe: Firſt, the elect only, &amp; not all men loſt in Adam the head, are redeemed from the curſe of the Law, for the ſin of Adam. Secondly, all the promiſes of ſalvation are made to the elect only, and not to all men in generall. Thirdly, univerſall grace of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall faith by the perfection of the redemption, is peremptorily denyed, and conſequently and neceſſarily the grace of morall repentance. Fourthly, the morall freedome of the will, without any neceſſitating of the will of man to morall diſobedience, is denyed by the act of the redemption. Fifthly, the election of man to ſalvation, is out of the alone free pleaſure of God, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all ſubordinate reſpect to the Lords merit. Sixthly, the condemnation of man to the eternall torments of hel, is out of the alone pleaſure of God, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all ſubordinate reſpect to the Law of God, or to the merit of man, by tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of the Law. Seventhly, children dying unbaptized, are ſaved by the parents faith, and a number of ſuch. All which pretended fundamentall points of faith, are contradictory to the light of the truth of the Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Law of righteouſneſſe of faith; for removing of which falſe funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall errors, and of all manner of erronious tenents, repugnant to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Evangelicall Law of faith, the judicious Reader is enabled by a ſhort rule or canon in the third Book. And ſo much for anſwer to the firſt objection; by anſwering whereof, the judicious Reader may plainly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that though Satan and his inſtruments hath the power, by his falſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving naturall light, to unite the naturall love of man, irreſiſtibly to the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive object of his pleaſure; yet the union is by the free yeelding and aſſent of the will of man, to be ſo induced by Satan, and not by Satans neceſſitating
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:49359:70"/> of the free love of man: And that it is in the freedome of mans naturall election, before Satans temptation, to be induced to diſobedience by his falſe deceiving envious naturall light. As for Satans falſe deceiving morall light, whereby he doth incenſe the heart of man to maintain ſuch pretended points of faith, ſo contradictory to the Evangelical Law of faith: The judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Reader may likewiſe plainly perceive, that it is in the freedome of man<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <head type="sub">The true ſenſe of the words, that both the will and deed is from God, and the ſenſe of the words, that the thoughts of man are only and continually evill; origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſin is not the corruption of nature, and of the rebellious will of the fleſh, which is ſaid to be enmity againſt God.</head>
               <p>IT is ſecondly objected: God giveth both the will and the deed; man therefore, by the perfection of the redemption, hath neither the free power of will, neither to will or do any good. I anſwer, the Antecedent is moſt true, but the Inference is falſe; for the grace of morall faith, which is the act of the redeemed will of man, proceeding from the power of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed word of the Law and life of righteouſneſſe of faith, written in the heart of man, and the deed of the will, which is the work of morall faith, proceeding from the immediate power of the life of righteouſneſſe of faith, is the gift of God, in his Son Chriſt Jeſus, by the immediate act of the redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion given to man; by the immediate act of which gracious gift, man doth both will and do moral good: Neither is it affirmed by us, that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed man, by the morall free act of his will, hath the power ſimply to
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:49359:71"/> will, or do any good, but that he hath this morall freedome without any manner of neceſſitating of his will to morall diſobedience: For, otherwiſe, as hath been formerly and neceſſarily demonſtrate, it were impoſſible for God without injuſtice, to oblige man, either to his old or new covenant.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it is objected: The thoughts of man are only and continually evill, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.5. Man therefore, by the perfection of the redemption, cannot ſo much as think of any good, much leſſe to do any good; To this I anſwer: The thoughts of man, in this place, and in all ſuch other places of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to this purpoſe, muſt be underſtood of the thoughts of the naturall man, and not of the regenerate, as he is a ſpirituall man; for the regenerate man, (1 <hi>John</hi> 3.9.) is born of God, and cannot ſin, neither can his thought be evill, as he is a ſpirituall man: And though the regenerate man, as he is a naturall man, and not perfectly ſanctified in this life, doth actually ſin, too often againſt the command of the Law, both as the Law is ſpirituall and literall (for as the regenerate man doth know but in part, ſo he doth do but in part, while he is in this life;) yet by the regenerate mans ſpiri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uall faith in the Lords merit, all his actuall ſins are covered; and herein ſtands the regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate mans only comfort. And therefore Paul doth affirm, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.22, 23. that in the inner man (that is, as he is regenerate) he doth delight in the Law of God, and doth diſclaim his actuall ſins, both of thought and deed, to be his (to wit) as he is regenerate, but as he is a naturall man, attributing all his actuall ſins, to the rebellious will of his fleſh. The thoughts of man therefore in this place, are to be underſtood, chiefly of the thoughts of the wicked man, though they may be always underſtood of the naturall man in generall before he be regenerate: For, all the naturall mans thoughts and works before he be regenerate, are ſpirituall ſin, and ſpirituall evill, becauſe he wants ſpirituall faith; and becauſe his morall evill action is both actuall, ſpirituall and morall ſin and evill; and therefore his thoughts accordingly are evill continually; for at the beſt, they ſpiritually and continually evill; and this is the reaſon that Job ſaith, <hi>Job</hi> 14.4. <hi>Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean thing?</hi> that is to ſay, who is able to bring forth a clean thought or work out of an unclean heart: For, Job doth acknowledge himſelf, as he is a naturall man, to be corrupted from his youth by actuall ſin: But Job doth juſtifie himſelf, as he is regenerate, by faith in the aſſurance of his ſalvation. But though the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall man, before he be regenerate, hath not the ſpirituall power, either to think or do any ſpirituall good; yet by the power of the redeemed word of the Law and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ife of Righteouſneſſe of faith, written in his heart, he is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled with the morall power, both to think, and to do a good morall work of faith, without any manner of neceſſitating of his will to morall diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:49359:71"/> As by the power of that word he is likewiſe enabled with the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall grace of repentance, to repent morally of his ſin when he falls by the Devils temptation, and that without any power to neceſſitate his impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitencie.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, it is objected, that the will of the fleſh, is enmity againſt God, (<hi>Rom.</hi> 8.7.) and cannot be ſubject to the Law of God. The redeemed na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall man therfore, by the perfection of the redemption, cannot produce a good morall work of faith, becauſe his beſt morall work is enmity againſt God. I anſwer: This ſubjection of man to the Law of God (meaned in this place by the Apoſtle) is the ſubjection of man to the ſpirituall command of the Law, as the Law is ſpirituall: and this enmity is ſpirituall enmity againſt God. In which ſenſe, it is impoſſible for the redeemed naturall man, before he be regenerate, to be ſubject to the ſpirituall command of the Law; but though the naturall man, before he be regenerate, cannot be ſubject to the ſpirituall command of the Law, as the Law is ſpirituall; yet, as the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Law is literall and morall, the naturall man, by the power of the word of the Law, and life of righteouſneſſe of faith in his heart, he is morally enabled to be ſubject to the literall command of the Law, without any manner of neceſſitating of his will to morall diſobedience; and though the moral act of his will be neceſſarily ſpirituall enmity againſt the ſpirituall command of the Law (through want of ſpirituall faith;) yet the act of his morall obedience is not morall enmity againſt God or his Law.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, it is objected: Man is born in the corruption of nature, which is originall ſin; by which naturall corruption, man is neceſſitate to actuall ſin. The act of the will of man therefore, by the perfection of the redemption is not free from all manner of neceſſitating to morall diſobedience. I anſwer: Though originall ſin be commonly called the corruption of nature; yet it is falſly called the corruption of nature; though I do not deny that actuall ſin may be called the corruption of nature; and yet this aſſertion muſt be warily conceived: For, we muſt not think, that the nature of man is eſſentially corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; for ſo the incorruptible ſoul of man, which is the firſt act of man, as he is man, muſt be corrupted, which is impoſſible. But it is the formall morall act of the will only, which is corrupted by the multiplied acts of ſin, which is only actuall, and not originall ſin: For, if we ſhould take the corrupted act of the will, by the multiplied acts of ſin, for originall ſin, God muſt be the inevitable author of actuall ſin ſince the fall; and originall ſin, which is no ſin, to death, muſt be a ſin to death, I mean, actuall death, contrary to all truth; for God by concluding all redeemed men in ſpirituall darkneſſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.32. which is called unbelief, and originall ſin, hath mercy upon all men; for
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:49359:72"/> without the concluding of man in ſpirituall darkneſſe, it is impoſſible, in the ordinary calling of God, that any man can be regenerate by ſpirituall faith, and conſequently and neceſſarily originall ſin is not the corruption of nature.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, the objection is further preſt: The Apoſtle, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.3. doth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, that all men are the children of wrath by nature. This wrath of God therefore, muſt be for the originall ſin, and conſequently originall ſin is the corruption of nature, I anſwer: If the wrath of God muſt be for originall ſin, then Gods wrath muſt be upon his own immediate act; for originall ſin is the immediate act of God, proceeding from the Spirituall darkneſſe and unbelief, wherein all redeemed men are concluded by God, that he might have mercy upon all, and not that his wrath ſhould be upon all: But it is plain, that in this whole Chapter, the Apoſtle ſpeaks of actuall, and not of originall ſin: For, the Apoſtle doth acknowledge, that he had his converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in times paſt, amongſt the children of diſobedience, which diſobedience is by the multiplied acts of ſin, and actuall ſin from the falſe deceiving light of Satan and his inſtruments, in a manner, from the cradle, by the continued acts whereof, ſin becomes ſo habituall and connaturall, as it ſeemeth to be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall to man; and this is the ſin, and not originall ſin, which doth draw down the wrath of God upon man temporally in this life, (and without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and amendment) eternall wrath in the life to come; and therefore becauſe Paul, before his converſion, had his converſation amongſt the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of diſobedience from his youth; Paul calls himſelf the child of wrath by nature; for the children of diſobedience, are the begotten children of Satan; for ſuch is Satans vigilancy and early care, to breed up his children by the ſowing of his curſed envious ſeed, ſweetned with his falſe naturall deceiving light, as he begins to ſow his ſeed in the ears and hearts of all children before the children can ſin actually, or know any kinde of evill. To this end, Satan hath his young inſtruments, that by their converſement with children, they may be taught to lie, curſe, and ſwear, in a manner, ſo ſoon as they are able to ſpeak. By this means, little children do begin to be acquainted with the terms of evill, though the envious poiſon of the evill do not burſt out, untill children come to actuall morall underſtanding and action, and then by the poyſon of Satans envious ſeed, children do begin to practiſe childiſh evill, and to be averſe; and with a childiſh obſtinacy, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt any controler of their childiſh evill actions; for the more they are checkt, ſuch is the power of Satans ſeed, that they will bend their power to do evill, the rather by this means, unleſſe they be ſanctified from the womb; the act of the childs will, (by degrees) becomes to be morally corrupted with ſin and evill; and as the child groweth up in yeers, ſin and evill groweth up with the
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:49359:72"/> childe, and becomes ſo habituall and connaturall to man, as (without the great mercy of God by his concurſive grace, and the great care of the parents) it is as eaſie to take away his nature, as to win him from the pleaſure of ſin; ſuch is the corrupted multiplied act of his will, morally to all evill and miſchief, by his continuall converſement with Satans inſtruments the torch-bearers of Satans falſe deceiving naturall light: For, by the power of Satans envious deceiving naturall light, the heart of man is ſo incenſed to every foul object of ſenſitive pleaſure; as the naturall pleaſure of man is extended to the pride of naturall pleaſure: And this is the reaſon that actuall ſin is called the corruption of nature: For it is the formall naturall act of the will of man, which is ſo abuſed by Satans falſe deceiving naturall light, as it is extended to ſuch a height, as the formall naturall act of the will becomes for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally morall, and morally ſin and evill. And theſe are the children of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.3. which are called the children of wrath by nature; and theſe are the children of diſobedients, amongſt whom, Paul doth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge himſelf to have had his converſation in times paſt. This corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the naturall act of the will of man, by the multiplied acts of ſin, is called the rebellious will of the fleſh, becauſe the will of the naturall man before he be regenerate, rebels againſt the ſpirituall command of the Law, and cannot be ſubject to the Law. It is called the old man: Firſt, becauſe this corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the naturall act of the will of man, (by Satan and his inſtruments) is from his childhood. Secondly, it is called the old man, in reſpect of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate man, who is called the new man: It is called the body of ſin, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the naturall man, before he be regenerate, is dead in actuall ſin, and therefore, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.23. it is likewiſe called the body of death; becauſe death is the wages of ſin: It is called concupiſcence, becauſe by the multiplied acts of ſin, all the parts and powers of the naturall man are corrupted. By the long continuance of man in actuall ſin, whereby the long patience of God, (leading man to repentance) is contemned with ſuch an high hand, as God in his juſtice doth give wretched man over to a reprobate minde: He is called by the Apoſtle, the compacted veſſell of Gods wrath: For, the wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched obſtinate ſinner, is compacted of actuall ſpirituall ſin, and of actuall morall evill, and therefore the body of ſin and death.</p>
               <p>By my anſwer to this objection, I hope the judicious Reader is fully ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, that originall ſin is not the corruption of nature: And that it is plain blaſphemy to be ſo called; for ſo God muſt be the inevitable author of actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ſin; yet the objection is further preſt.</p>

               <p>SEventhly, it is objected, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51 5. David doth affirm himſelf to be conceived and born of his mother in ſin and iniquity; which ſin and ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity muſt be by the corruption of the naturall, morall, and ſpirituall act of his will. Though David therefore was not conceived and born in any eſſentiall corruption of his nature; yet David was conceived and born of his mother in the naturall, morall and ſpirituall corrupted act of his will.</p>
               <p>I anſwer: In Davids firſt conception by his mother, (which is the ſemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall and ſenſitive conception of man) there is neither any naturall, morall, or ſpiritu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ll corruption in the act; for it was the good naturall act of Davids mother, as ſhe was the good redeemed creature of God. And as for his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſecond conception, while as David was conceived man, and the ſon of Adam, in the womb, by the eſſentiall union of his intellectuall and ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive nature, this was the immediate act of the Father of ſpirits; by which immediate act of God, as David was redeemed in Adam, the redeemed head of man (according to his eternall decree): So David by the immediate act of God in the womb, was ſhut up in temporall ſpirituall darkneſſe, and ſo brought forth by his mother, ſhut up in that ſpirituall darkneſſe which is called unbelief and originall ſin; But there was neither any ſpirituall or morall corruption in that ſpirituall darkneſſe: For, though David by his concluding in ſpirituall darkneſſe was dead, as he was a ſpiri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y. Neither was there any morall corruption of the will in this ſpirituall darkneſſe wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in David was ſhut up in the womb, and conceived and born by his mother; for the morall corrupted act of the will is actuall, and not originall ſin. And this is the manner that originall ſin doth deſcend upon all men from Adam, the redeemed head of man; and this is the ſin and iniquity (which is ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall ſin and iniquiquity, through deſcent of ſpirituall faith,) wherein Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid doth acknowledge, that he was conceived and born by his mother, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from the ſpirituall darkneſſe wherein David was ſhut up and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in the womb; and this is that ſin which is ſaid, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.12. to have
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:49359:73"/> entred by one man in the world, and naturall temporall death, which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed that ſin. Though David therefore, out of the agony of his ſpirituall paſſion, for offending of his gracious God, doth extend his paſſion to his ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry conception, bewailing, as it were, the time of his conception and birth, by his mother; yet far be it from any Chriſtian heart to conceive, that Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid did attribute the cauſe of his foul adultery and murther to his mother; for ſo David muſt charge not only his mother, but God himſelf, as the cauſe of his foul fact: For, God did conclude David in originall ſin, and his mother did conceive and bring forth David in originall ſin. But David doth not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute the cauſe of his ſin, either to his conception, or to his birth; no, not ſo much as to the Devill and his inſtruments, by whoſe falſe envious deceiving naturall light, Davids heart was ſo inflamed to that miſerable adulterous bloody fact, but David doth attribute the cauſe of all to his own heart: For, after David was rowzed up from his deadly ſecurity by the Prophet, Davids heart, for his ſorrow and grief for his ſin was broke (as it were) in pieces; for he fell down before God, humbly confeſſing his ſin, and acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that by the foulneſſe of his ſins, he had moſt juſtly deſerved to be caſt from the eternall preſence of God, which with all humbleneſſe of his broken heart, he prayeth to God to be forgiven; and that God would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new his heart, which the ſorrow of his ſins had ſo broken: For, it is the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean foul heart of man, corrupted by Satan and his inſtruments, that is, the immediate cauſe of all actuall ſin (and neither the father or mother) which the Lord called the ſtorehouſe of evill. And therefore David doth pray to the Lord again and again, to purge and purifie his heart from the uncleanneſſe of his adulterous bloody fact.</p>
               <p>But it may be inſtanced, Davids mother was to offer (by the Law) a ſin-offering, for the purification of her uncleanneſſe, in bringing forth of David, which was the uncleanneſſe and corruption of originall ſin, wherein David was conceived and born. I anſwer: There was neither any naturall, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, or ſpirituall corruption, or uncleanneſſe in women, in bringing forth of children, under the ceremoniall Law, only the flux of blood in women by bringing forth man, was made ceremoniall ſin and uncleanneſſe by the poſitive command of the ceremoniall Law, that by the offering up a ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for her ceremoniall ſin, the woman might be put in minde of her thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe to God, for the bloody ſacrifice of the bleſſed childe to be born of woman, whoſe blood was to be ſhed for the redemption of man; the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit whereof the woman did then enjoy, whereby ſhe was enabled to bring forth man into the world.</p>
               <p>The Objection is yet further preſt: David was circumciſed the eighth
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:49359:74"/> day: By the amputation of Davids foreskin, the corruption of David by ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall ſin was ſignified. I anſwer: The ſacrament of circumciſion was not inſtituted, either for originall or actuall ſin; but it was inſtituted for the ſacrament of the ſecond covenant, in the promiſe of the bleſſed ſeed; and that for theſe two reaſons: Firſt, that the childe coming to the yeers of actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all underſtanding, might be put in minde, by the ſhedding of his blood by the ſacrament of circumciſion, that he was ſaved from the firſt death, for the curſe of the Law for the ſin of Adam by the blood of the bleſſed ſeed to be born of woman; and that by faith in the promiſed merit of the bleſſed ſeed, he was ſaved from the ſecond death. The ſecond reaſon was, that by the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of circumciſion, the childe might be aſſured, that he was as really and truly in the covenant, as either Adam or Abraham, to whom the promiſe was made.</p>

               <head type="sub">The immediate object of Gods eternall purpoſe by his Decree of election, in the order of cauſe, is the redeemed ſtate of man.</head>
               <p>EIghtly, it is objected, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.13. God did hate Eſau in the womb, whoſe hatred to Eſau muſt be for originall ſin. By originall ſin therefore, the will of man is neceſſitate to diſobedience from the womb.</p>
               <p>I anſwer: Gods hatred to Eſau, was neither for originall or actuall ſin; but that the purpoſe of God might ſtand according to election, by him that calleth, to wit, by ſpirituall faith. The denying therefore of this election by him that calleth to Eſau, is ſignified by this word hate: For, in this caſe, by the word hatred, the free act of God is expreſſed in electing one by his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall calling, and not another; and this was only Gods hatred to Eſau: For, though Eſau was Iſaacs firſt born, and the naturall ſeed of Abraham, and heir of Iſaacs temporall eſtate; yet Eſau was not heir of the ſpirituall promiſe, the reaſon is, becauſe the ſpirituall promiſe is only by ſpirituall faith, which is the free gift and grace of the holy Spirit, and cannot be tied to the naturall ſeed of man, to any time, place, or perſon; but it is in the free gift of God, in his Son Chriſt Jeſus, to beſtow on whom he will. And this is that free gift, by conferring or denying whereof, God is ſaid to have mercy, or not to have mercy upon man: For, though God ſhould beſtow the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt temporall bleſſing of this life upon man; yet without the free gift of ſpirituall faith, ſuch great temporall bleſſings are but ſo many temptations to induce man to actuall ſin. Who could have more temporall bleſſings then great King Pharoah? or Eſau, of whom ſo many Princes and Nobles did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend;
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:49359:74"/> yet neither Pharoah, or Eſau, had the gift of ſpirituall faith, which was from all eternity decreed to be denied to both. And why? becauſe the gift of ſpirituall faith is the free gift of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.18. who will ſhew mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy on whom he will ſhew mercy, and wil deny his mercy to whom he will deny his mercy; for in this caſe, Gods love and mercy, in his Son Chriſt Jeſus, is free, and not obliged to any redeemed man, naturally deſcended, or to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend of Adam. I ſay, to any redeemed man, becauſe this promiſe of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall faith in the bleſſed ſeed was made to Abraham and his ſeed in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed ſtate. And becauſe the grace of ſpirituall faith is the free gift of God, God did decree from all eternity, that Jacob, and not Eſau, ſhould be heir of the ſpirituall promiſe. And therefore, God decreed from all eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that the bleſſed ſeed ſhould not deſcend of Eſaus line; for God in his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall preſcience, did foreſee, that Eſau would ſell his birthright, without any manner of morall reaſon, to neceſſitate his ungracious ſale: For, though the ſpirituall promiſe was never intended to Eſau, yet it was more then Eſau knew, who by his ungracious ſale, did contemn and miſregard the ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all promiſe made to his father Iſaac; and therefore it was ſaid, of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren before they were born, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.12. <hi>The elder ſhall ſerve the younger,</hi> which was afterwards accompliſhed: For, the Edomites were expelled the Land of Edome, and overrun and ſubdued by the Iſraelites. And this is the reaſon that David ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 108.9. <hi>Over Edom will I caſt my ſhooe;</hi> whereby the trampling down and ſubjection of the Edomites is myſtically ſignified. Of this example of Jacob and Eſau, ſet down by the Apoſtle, two ſpeciall points are to be obſerved: Firſt, Paul having to do in this ninth Chapter, with the bragging Jews, who did brag that they were heirs of the ſpirituall promiſe made to Abraham, becauſe they were the naturall ſeed of Abraham; and becauſe the Oracles of the propheticall ceremoniall Law was committed to them, the Jews therefore ſecured themſelves; that by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming of the ceremoniall works of the Law, that they were heirs of the ſpirituall promiſe. Paul therefore brings in the example of Jacob and Eſau, to check the Jews of their arrogancie, and tels them plainly, that though they were the naturall ſeed of Abraham, and had the Oracles of the Law, yet they were never the neerer, becauſe the ſpirituall promiſe is according to election, by him that calleth by faith, and not by the works of the Law; and that the Jews by their ceremoniall works of the Law did utterly overthrow all faith, by which they were called. The Apoſtle therefore, to the end of the Epiſtle, out of his true love to the Jews, doth exhort the Jews, now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Evangelicall Law of faith, to leave off the ceremoniall works of the Law, if they intended to be heirs of the ſpirituall promiſe, which is by faith
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:49359:75"/> of him that calleth; and to bring forth the works of faith by repentance, and amendment of life; that by continuation in their morall obedience (till Gods prefixed time of ſpirituall calling) they might be ſpiritually called, whereby they ſhould be aſſured that they were heirs of the ſpirituall promiſe made to Abraham. The ſecond point to be obſerved of the words is this: that in the order of cauſe, the redeemed eſtate of man from the curſe of the Law, for the ſin of Adam, ſhut up in ſpirituall darkneſſe, called unbelief, and originall ſin, is the immediate object of Gods election: For, though this eſtate of man doth neceſſarily preſuppoſe both the condition of man, created in the ſtate of naturall and ſpirituall perfection, in Adam the head, and the ſtate of man condemned to the curſe of the Law, by eternall death and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for the ſin of Adam, the head; yet neither of both the ſtates of man, in the order of cauſe, can be the immediate object of Gods election; for it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that the ſtate of naturall and ſpirituall perfection, wherein man was created, can be the immediate object of Gods election in the order of cauſe: For, the Law by which man was obliged, by the firſt covenant, was the Law of Righteouſneſſe, and not the Law of righteouſneſſe of faith. Now, by the Law of Righteouſneſſe, the eternall bleſſing of the firſt ſeventh dayes reſt, was due by the Law, immediately to the works of mans obedience, whereby man was enabled to live eternally upon earth in the ſtate of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and felicity, wherein he was created; while man therefore, did ſtand in the perfection of his obedience, there was no place or need of Gods eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall purpoſe of election by him that calleth, to wit, by ſpirituall faith: For the period of Gods election, by his calling by ſpirituall faith, is, that man may be crowned with an incorruptible crown of glory after this life; while man in the ſtate of perfection was to live eternally upon earth in that ſtate of felicity wherein he was created. And as the eternall bleſſing of the firſt ſeventh dayes reſt was due by the Law, immediatly to the works of mans obedience, ſo upon the laſt merit of mans diſobedience, man was inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably condemned by the Law to the eternall curſe of the Law, to the actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all inflicting of which curſe, God, according to his decree from all eternity, did ſo bind and oblige himſelf by covenant, as there was no mercy to be ſhewed to man: For, in this caſe man being condemned by the Law to the curſe of eternall death by the firſt covenant; it had been all one for God not to be God, as not to inflict the actuall curſe of the Law upon man: For, by this means, Gods truth and juſtice had been overthrown. His truth had been overthrown by the breach of his covenant; and his juſtice by diſabling the power of his Law. There was no place therefore for God to ſhew mercy, or not to ſhew mercy by his Decree of election in the condition of man crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:49359:75"/> in the ſtate of naturall and ſpirituall perfection, either to the merit of mans obedience, or to the merit of mans diſobedience. It was likewiſe equally impoſſible in the order of cauſe, for the ſtate of man actually con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by the curſe of the Law to eternall death and darkneſſe to be the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate object of Gods election: For, firſt, Gods eternall fiery wrath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from the curſe of the Law, to which man was eternally condemned, and Gods mercy by his election doth ſtand at an eternall diſtance and oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, without a mediator; by whoſe mediation in ſatisfying the tranſgreſſed Law for man, and in reconciling of man to the love and favour of God, there may be place for the freedome of Gods mercy by his election. Secondly, if this ſtate of man actually condemned under the eternall curſe of the Law in the order of cauſe, ſhould be the immediate object of Gods election, then the elect only, and not all men fallen under the curſe of the Law in Adam the head; for the ſin of Adam ſhould be redeemed, contradictory both to the old and new covenant, and to the whole current of Scripture. Thirdly, the Potter of Righteouſneſſe, is ſaid to make and temper the lump and maſſe of man whereof he makes his veſſels of honour and diſhonour, <hi>Rom</hi> 9.21. But the maſſe of man actually condemned to the curſe of the Law, by eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall death and darkneſſe, for the tranſgreſſion of the Law in Adam, is a maſſe of the Devils tempering; for it was by the Devils falſe betraying of man, that man was brought to that curſed eſtate. It is therefore impoſſible that God ſhould make his veſſels out of this curſed maſſe of man; and that this ſtate of man ſhould be the immediate object of Gods election in the order of cauſe. The maſſe of man therefore, whereof the Potter of Righteouſneſſe doth make his veſſels of honour and diſhonour, is the only ſtate of man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed from the curſe of eternall death and darkneſſe, for the ſin of Adam, ſhut up in temporall ſpirituall darkneſſe, called unbelief, and originall ſin, which maſſe of man is tempered with the ſacred blood of Chriſt Jeſus, the Son of God, as he is man, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13. who made himſelf a curſe for man, to redeem man from the curſe of the Law, for the ſin of Adam: For, out of this only eſtate of man, it is in the free pleaſure of God in his Son Chriſt Jeſus, (without all impeachment to his juſtice) to ſhew mercy on whom he will ſhew mercy, and to deny his mercy to whom he will deny his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; and at his free pleaſure, out of this maſſe, to make veſſels of honour or diſhonour. The reaſon whereof is next to be declared.</p>

Thirdly, by the curſed death of the Lord of life, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19. whereby the tranſgreſſed Law by man was ſatisfied, all men in this redeemed eſtate are juſtified by the Law for that firſt ſin. Fourthly, all men by his death in this redeemed eſtate, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.10. are perfectly reconciled to the love and favour of God for that firſt ſin. Fifthly, by the perfection of the redeemed word of the Law and life of Righteouſneſſe, firſt written in the heart of man, from the curſe; all men by the power of the redeemed word in the heart, are equally en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled again to live the naturall life of man; and morally to live the life of Righteouſneſſe of faith, without any manner of naturall or morall neceſſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the will of man to morall diſobedience: For, unleſſe all men were ſo naturally and morally enabled by the perfection of the redemption, it were impoſſible for God to make any covenant with man ſince the fall, as hath been formerly demonſtate. In this redeemed ſtate of man therefore, all men were equally and morally enabled to enter the old covenant with God, and now all men are equally enabled to enter the new covenant, and to give mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall obedience to the Evangelicall command of the Law, without any man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of power to neceſſitate their will to morall diſobedience. And this is the firſt grace of God to man, and therefore called the ſtate of grace; for the ſtate of the redemption of man, doth ſo far ſurmount the ſtate of the created perfection of man, as far as the invaluable ſacred blood of the Son of God, doth ſurmount all the creatures created by God. Out of this redeemed ſtate of man, God, according to his eternall purpoſe, hath decreed from all eternity, to elect a certain number, by predeſtinating them to be made like to the Image of his Son, whereby they are preſerved from being overcome by the temptation of Satan and of his inſtruments, till they be ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually called; that by ſpirituall faith they may overcome the ſtrongeſt

And theſe are the veſſels of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour mentioned here by the Apoſtle. As for the veſſels of diſhonour, which are ſaid here by the Apoſtle to be made by God, it is moſt warily to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived: For, as it is moſt certain, that God hath decreed to elect a certain number to be made like to the image of his Son, out of the redeemed ſtate of man: So it is as certain, that God hath decreed from all eternity, to relinquiſh a certain number in the grace of this redeemed eſtate; and to leave them at their pleaſure to be finally overcome, or not overcome, by the temptation of Satan and his inſtruments: For, by mans wilfull yeelding to be finally over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by Satans temptation, he wilfully deprives himſelf of his ſpirituall cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. But in this dereliction of man in the grace of his redeemed eſtate, four main points are to be judiciouſly conſidered: The firſt is, that this num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of men, who are thus relinquiſhed, are known to God alone. The ſecond is, that theſe men are ſo armed by the perfection of their redemption againſt the power of Satan and his inſtruments, as all the powers of hell are not able to neceſſitate the will of the redeemed man to morall diſobedience, but that he muſt freely and willingly yeeld himſelf to be induced by the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Satan and his inſtruments, or he can never be overcome by Satan. The third point is this, that ſuch is the power of their morall grace, that though Satan by his falſe envious deceiving light, do make them ſtumble and fall, yet by the perfection of their redemption, they are morally enabled to riſe again to repent them of their ſin, to pray to God to pardon their actuall ſin, and to reconcile themſelves again to God, without any manner of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted power to neceſſitate their impenitency; and God hath ſo obliged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by covenant, as his arms of mercy are outſtretched to the penitent ſinner at what time ſoever. The fouth point to be conſidered is, that the new co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant is as freely made to theſe whom God hath relinquiſhed in the grace of their redeemed eſtate, as to the elect: For, the new covenant is made to all the nations of the world, obliging the morall faith of the naturall man to the obedience of the Evangelicall Law of faith, as the ſpirituall faith of the regenerate man to his ſpirituall obedience; and therefore the Evangelicall Law of Righteouſneſſe of faith, is firſt and immediately morally commanded, though neceſſarily implying the ſpirituall command, and the morall bleſſing of the ſeventh dayes Evangelicall reſt, is as due morally to the morall faith of the naturall man, as ſpiritually to the ſpirituall faith of the rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate. And this is all that can be affirmed to God by his relinquiſhing of man in the grace of his redeemed eſtate. Who is therefore able to ſay,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:49359:77"/> that theſe men are the veſſels of diſhonour? do not the regenerate man ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times foulely fall? and many times more foulely then the naturall man; for theſe men, whom God hath thus relinquiſhed, are known to God alone, except a few, who are branded in this life, that all men may be warned by forſaking of their ſins, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.12. to work out their ſalvation with fear and trembling. And therefore we are commanded not to judge; for who knows the time of Gods ſpirituall calling? doth not the greateſt ſinner many times by his ſpirituall calling in Gods prefixed time, become a pillar of the Church, and ſuch was Paul? Then the queſtion may be moved: How comes theſe men thus relinquiſhed by God, to be made by God the veſſels of diſhonour? The Apoſtle doth anſwer the queſtion; which is this, in a word, God doth ſuffer theſe wicked men to contemne his patience ſo long with ſuch a high hand, as God to ſhew his wrath, and to make his power known, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.22. hath juſtly made them to deſtruction; and theſe are the veſſels of diſhonour, and the veſſels of his wrath. The immediate cauſe therefore, that God hath made theſe wicked men the veſſels of his wrath, is their obſtinate finall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temning of Gods long patience; and the immediate cauſe of their finall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temning of Gods long patience, is the baſe abuſing of the freedome of their morall grace, purchaſed at the high rate of the ſacred blood of the Son of God; for by their finall continuing in unrepented actuall ſin and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, they abuſe the free power of their morall grace, without any manner of power to neceſſitate their diſobedience, and by their abuſing of the grace of their redemption, they do tread underfoot the blood of the new covenant. It is in the behalf of theſe wretched men that the Apoſtle doth move the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection in the 19. verſe of this Chapter, and anſwers to the objection. The ſenſe of the objection is this: If God hath made me to deſtruction, who hath reſiſted his will, or who can help it, God hath made me thus, and I much not be againſt it? To this the Apoſtle anſwers, O man, who art thou that pleadeſt ſo injuſtly againſt God? ſhall the thing formed, ſay to the former, why haſt thou made me thus? to wit, while thou haſt given him ſo juſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to make thee thus. Hath not the Potter power of the clay to make of the ſame lump one veſſel to honour, and another to diſhonour? As if the Apoſtle would have ſaid, Was thou not made of the ſame lump of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed ſtate of man that the elect was made? and was not thou left in the like grace of morall power with the elect? and was there any thing to ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitate thy foul finall contempt and diſobedience more then was in the elect? And now, while by thy wilfull finall obſtinate contempt of God, thou haſt brought thy ſelf to ſuch a miſerable paſſe, that God hath moſt juſtly made thee the veſſel of his wrath; thou doſt now moſt injuſtly blame God
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:49359:77"/> for thy own miſerable act. But in the mean time we muſt warily conſider againſt whom Paul doth preſſe this point: For, Paul doth here diſpute againſt the Jews, whoſe ſalvation he prefers to his own. And therefore we muſt conſider, that the Apoſtle by preſſing of this point, is far from giving any occaſion to the Jews to diſpair of the mercies of God in his Son Chriſt Jeſus, which of all ſins is the moſt fearfull: For, the Apoſtle by preſſing of this point, labours to break the Jews from their ceremoniall works of the Law, whereby they did ſo obſtinately contemn the Evangelicall Law of Righteouſneſſe of faith, exhorting them to the end of the Epiſtle, by the works of repentance, and amendment of life; and, as it were, to work out their election and ſalvation with fear and trembling, and to leave off their ceremoniall works of the Law, to the upholding whereof they were ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed by the power of Satan and his inſtruments, whereby they did ſo contemn the long patience of God leading them ſo graciouſly to repentance.</p>
               <p>Here ariſeth an objection to be anſwered: God by his Decree of election, hath predeſtinate a certain number out of the redeemed ſtate of man to eternall ſalvation; God therefore, (according to the rule of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries) by his eternall Decree, hath predeſtinate a certain number relinqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in their redeeemed eſtate, to deſtruction, reprobation, and actuall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation.</p>
               <p>I anſwer: Firſt, the inference is moſt falſe and blaſphemous: For, by this inference, God is made the inevitable author, not only of actuall ſin, but of the finall continuance of man in actuall ſin; and of mans contemning of his long patience, whereby man is made the veſſell of wrath to his eternall deſtruction, and all by God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I anſwer, that the election of man out of his redeemed eſtate of man to ſalvation, and the reprobation, deſtruction, or condemnation of man, are no wayes immediate contraries, and therefore the inference moſt falſe and fallacious: For, though the election of man out of the grace of the redeemed eſtate, and the relinquiſhing of man in the grace of the redeemed ſtate of man be immediatly oppoſite; yet many things doth interveen before God can make man the veſſell of his wrath to deſtruction, to ſhew his wrath, and to manifeſt the glory of his power according to the Apoſtles words: For, firſt, temptation of Satan and his inſtruments muſt incenſe the heart of man to the pleaſure of ſin: Secondly, man muſt continue in ſin, wickedneſſe, and uncleanneſſe: Thirdly, though the naturall man continue in ſin, yet all this while he may morally repent; for as yet there is nothing to neceſſitate his morall impenitency: For, it is only the finall oſtinacy, contempt, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitency of man, that bars him from morall repentance: Fourthly, God
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:49359:78"/> muſt ſuffer his patience to be long provoked, untill the obſtinate finall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temner make himſelf the compacted veſſell of Gods wrath, paſt all feeling of ſin, giving himſelf over to all uncleanneſſe with greedineſſe. And this is the man whom the Apoſtle ſaith, that is made by God to deſtruction; the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate cauſe whereof, is the immediate precedent act of man; for God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not condemn man, but by the mediate condemnation of the Law; and his Law can never condemne man, but by the merit of mans finall obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate contempt and impenitency to the command of the Law interveening. Againſt this it is inſtanced, all things that comes to paſſe in this world, are by the power of Gods Decree of predeſtination. That theſe men therefore do ſo contemne the long patience of God; and that God doth ſo ſuffer in this world, it is by the power of his Decree. To this I anſwer, It is moſt certain, that all things that doth, or can come to paſſe in this world, falls un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the compaſſe of Gods decree; but all things that comes to paſſe in this life, are not from the poſitive actuall power of his Decree: For, a world of things comes to paſſe by the permiſſive power of his Decree, and ſo doth his ſuffering of his long patience to be ſo contemned by theſe wicked wretches, on whom he hath decreed to ſhew his wrath, and to declare his power to their eternall deſtruction, which is never actually inflicted upon man, till the great day, becauſe this fiery wrath of God doth proceed from the curſe of the Law inflicted upon man in the full extent, as he is man intellectuall and ſenſitive, which never can be inflicted upon man in this life, becauſe of the diſſolution of man in the intellectuall and ſenſitive nature of man; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the new covenant, whereby man hath all the day of this life to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent. Out of this which is declared in theſe laſt two Chapters, ariſing from the light of the truth of the ſacred Word of God; I do inferre this neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry concluſion: That abſolute imaginary decree, whereby God is affirmed out of his alone meer pleaſure, to elect a certain number of men to ſalvation, without all reſpect to the immediate object of his election, without reſpect to his ſpirituall calling, whereby the election doth ſtand, without reſpect to the immediate object of his ſpirituall calling, which is the Lords only merit, and conſequently without all reſpect to the Lord himſelf, ſecond perſon of the glorious Trinity. And that abſolute imaginary decree, whereby God is affirmed, out of his alone free pleaſure to condemne the reſt of the world to the eternall torments of hell, which is the curſe of the Law, without all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of mans meriting by his tranſgreſſion of the Law, without reſpect to the firſt covenant, whereby God and man were mutually obliged, without reſpect to the creation of man, in the ſtate of naturall and ſpirituall perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whereby man was perfectly enabled to fulfill the command of the Law

               <p>NInthly, it is objected out of our Saviours words: <hi>John</hi> 3.5. <hi>Except a man be born of water, and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdome of God.</hi> Children therefore departing this life in originall ſin, unbaptized, are condemned by the eternall curſe of the Law.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, the inference is fallacious: For, firſt, our Saviour ſpeaks here to Nicodemus, a Ruler and Teacher of the Jews, and not to man, that is a child. Secondly, Chriſt ſpeaks not here to Nicodemus ſimply, of the externall ſacrament of Baptiſme (which was then adminiſtred by John, and the Apoſtles) but of ſpirituall Baptiſme, which the externall ſacrament did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent; by which ſpirituall Baptiſme, the naturall mans ſpirituall darkneſſe (wherin he is ſhut up and dead, as he is a ſpirituall man) is ſpiritually inlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; by the ſanctifying power of which ſpirituall light, the naturall man is quickned again, and raiſed a new lively ſpirituall man by ſpirituall faith, who by the eyes of his ſpirituall faith, doth now ſee to enter the ſpirituall King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God. And this is the ſpirituall Baptiſme which our Saviour doth call the birth of the Spirit, and tels Nicodemus, that a man by externall Baptiſme ſimply (without this ſpirituall Baptiſme) cannot enter the Kingdom of God,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:49359:79"/> becauſe it is the free gift of God, and not tied to the externall adminiſtration of the Sacrament of Baptiſme. And therefore our Saviour doth compare this free gift of God by regeneration, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.8. to the freedome of the wind: For, as the wind doth freely blow where it liſteth; ſo doth the ſpirituall light of God enlighten whom he liſteth, by diſpercing the ſpirituall darkneſſe of the ſoul of man, to ſee the way to enter into the Kingdome of heaven. As con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the childs departing this life unbaptized by the externall ſacrament of Baptiſme: Firſt, the child is freed from the curſe of the Law, in Adam the redeemed head of man (in whom the child tranſgreſſed the Law,) who by the perfection of the redemption, is freed from the eternall curſe of the Law by the firſt covenant. Secondly, there is no actuall ſin in the child whereby the child can be liable to the curſe of the law of faith by the new covenant; which curſe is due only for actual ſin by final obſtinate contempt of the Law of faith. The child therefore is baptized with the ſacred blood and water iſſuing from the bleſſed heart of our Saviour upon the croſſe, which the externall ſacrament of Baptiſme doth repreſent. The child therefore departing this life, is ſaved by the ſacred blood of Chriſt Jeſus, and a glorious Saint in heaven, for of ſuch are the Kingdome of heaven: As the child therefore is ſaid to ſin in Adam, ſo the child is redeemed in Adam. It is not therefore the want of externall Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm which can condemne the child, unleſſe the child were of ſuch diſcretion of underſtanding, as the child did contemne the ſacrament of Baptiſme, (by the ſacramentall water) ſignifying the water of eternall life, wherby the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized is waſhed from his actuall ſins, wherein he is (as it were) drowned and dead, and is raiſed to the new life of faith to believe in the Lords merit, to ſave him from the ſecond death: For, in the primitive Church, they were only baptized who did actually believe. Al children therefore in the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Church, departing unbaptized, (by the conſequence of this fearfull ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection) ſhould be damned, contrary to the very words of the new covenant, he that doth believe, and ſhall be baptized, ſhall be ſaved.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E are now, (according to our Method) to declare ſuch acts of the bleſſed ſeed, as they are ſet down in his ſacred Word, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by him, while he was perſonally upon earth. Chriſt Jeſus the eternall Son of God, made fleſh of the ſeed of the woman, in time, according to the Decree of God from all eternity; as he is the firſt begotten Son of the moſt High (by his birthright) Prophet, Prieſt, and King, ſo by the execution of his three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold office, Chriſt Jeſus did manifeſt himſelf, Prophet, Prieſt, and King: Firſt, therefore, of the execution of his Propheticall office: Secondly, of his Prieſtly; and, Thirdly, of his Kingly office.</p>
                  <p>The execution of Chriſts Propheticall office, (while he was perſonally upon earth) was by the immediate power of his Word, as he himſelf was the promiſed reſt of the ſeventh day of the Propheticall Sabbath. Chriſt Jeſus, (the Word) as the redeemed Word, (his Image) is internally written in the
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:49359:80"/> heart of man, his Word is the redeemed light and life of man. And as his Word is externally objected to the externall ſenſes, he is the continuation of the redeemed life and light of man: His Word, under the propheticall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligement of the Law, was the word of the ſeventh day of the propheticall Sabbath, implying the whole propheticall Law, and the whole old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: As the life and light of the promiſed Sabbaticall reſt did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from his love to man; ſo Chriſt Jeſus, at his being perſonally in the world, did manifeſt himſelf light, love, and life to man. His light was in the ſound of his Word; and by the power of his Word, his miracles were wrought; and this was the light which did gloriouſly ſhine amongſt the Jews, while he was perſonally converſant with the Jews. This glorious light, by the ſound of his Word, did ſhine to the Jews, firſt, and immediatly, by his own immediate Word: And ſecondly, by the commanded miniſtry of the Apoſtles. By the light of his immediate Word; firſt the underſtanding of the Jews was enlightned in the propheſies, prophecying of the coming of the bleſſed ſeed, from the foundation of the world, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4.17. <hi>Mar.</hi> 1.21. <hi>Luke</hi> 4.21. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.13. whereby our Saviour did manifeſt himſelf to the Jews, that he was the promiſed reſt of their Sabbath; and that he was the ſeed of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who muſt die for the ſins of man, and reſt after his death, upon the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, for the recovering of the eternall reſt of the firſt ſeventh day, loſt by Adam; and that he it was, that muſt riſe again to break the head of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, for the betraying of man. All which was ſo many propheſies of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, whereby Chriſt did diſcharge his propheticall office, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.14. as he did likewiſe propheſie his death by the lifting up of the brazen Serpent, and his reſting in the grave, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.40. by Jonas reſt in the Whales belly, and both his death and reſurrection in ſaying, <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.19. <hi>Deſtroy this Temple, and in three dayes I will raiſe it again:</hi> So did he propheſie of the deſtruction of Jeruſalem, <hi>Luke</hi> 21.6. So his ſecond coming, and the day of judgement, and many ſuch like. Secondly, by this glorious ſhining light by the ſound of his Word, our Saviour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.20. did cleer the obſcured light of the Law, corrupted by the falſe gloſſe of the Scribes and Phariſees, ariſing from the Devils darkneſſe. Thirdly, as Chriſt Jeſus, while he was perſonally in the world, by the light of the ſound of his Word, the Jews underſtanding was inlightned to know, that he was the promiſed bleſſed ſeed: So by the light of the power of his Word, by his wonders and miracles, he did manifeſt himſelf to be the eternall Son of God. With the glorious fame of whoſe wonders and miracles, the whole world was filled and amazed; inſomuch that the Jews were conſtrained to acknowledge the Lord of life to be the Son of God, though the Jews dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe (led by the Devils falſe deceiving light) could not comprehend that
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:49359:80"/> glorious ſhining light. Fourthly, at this glorious light did proceed from the love of the Lord of life to man, by his promiſed Sabbatical reſt: So he did ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt his love (while he was perſonally upon earth) to man, in curing of all manner of incurable ſenſitive diſeaſes of the body, and the diſeaſed ſouls of many, by the pardoning of ſin. None were denied the bleſſing of his reſt, who came to him by the light of his love. As this glorious light did ſhine to the Jews immediatly, by Chriſt himſelf, as he was the promiſed reſt of the propheticall Sabbath day; ſo this glorious light did ſhine immediatly by the miniſtry of the Apoſtles, whom our Saviour did ſend abroad, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.7. to preach and teach this glorious ſhining light, ſhining from the Son of God; whom likewiſe (before his death and reſurrection) he authorized to preach and to teach the Evangel, and to adminiſtrate the Sacrament of Baptiſme; as John did firſt, before Chriſts manifeſting of himſelf to the world. And to the end that both Jew and Gentile might underſtand, that our Saviour was the promiſed bleſſed ſeed, propheſied by the propheticall Sabbath; our Saviour himſelf, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.13. was baptized by John, to let both the Jews and Gentiles underſtand, that as by his ſubmerſion, as it were, in the water, (by his baptiſm) that he it was, who muſt be drowned in the ſea of Gods eternall wrath, (by his curſed death of the croſſe) to redeem man from the curſe of the Law, for the ſin of all men in Adam: So by his riſing out of the water, both Jews and Gentiles might underſtand, that he ſhould riſe again from the curſed death of the croſſe. And though our Saviour himſelf did not baptize; yet the night that he was betrayed, he did inſtitute the Sacrament of the ſupper. All this was done by our Saviour, that all men might then know and underſtand, that Chriſt Jeſus was the end of the Law.</p>
                  <p>Here doth ariſe an objection: It was affirmed in the 29.30, 31. Chapters of the ſecond Book, that the continuation of the propheticall obligement of the Law was from the firſt period of the promiſe of the bleſſed ſeed to Adam, till the day of Chriſts reſurrection from the grave; and now by our Saviours own doctrine and preaching of the Evangelicall Word: And by his ſending of his Apoſtles to preach and teach, and to adminiſtrate the Sacrament of Baptiſme, and by his own adminiſtration of the Sacrament of the ſupper, all manifeſting, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.17. Chriſt Jeſus to be the end of the propheticall Law. The propheticall Law therefore, and the propheticall Sacraments were actually determined by our Saviour before either his death or reſurrection.</p>
                  <p>I anſwer: It is moſt truly affirmed by us, but the conſequence is falſly inferred: For, though Chriſt Ieſus before his death, did make his Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Will and Teſtament, ſealing his Will by the Evangelicall Sacraments; yet his Evangelicall Will and Teſtament, was not in force before the death
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:49359:81"/> of the Teſtator: And therefore, though our Saviour, did thus manifeſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf before his death by the execution of his propheticall office, by making of his laſt Will &amp; Teſtament, and by ſealing of his Will, by the inſtitution of the Evangelicall Sacraments; yet his propheticall Will and Teſtament ſealed by the propheticall Sacraments, was in force till the propheticall Sabbath day, (implying the command of the whole propheticall ceremoniall Law) was actually determined by the bleſſed day of Chriſts reſurrection. And ſo much for the diſcharging of Chriſts propheticall office at his firſt manifeſting of himſelf to the world. Next of the execution of his Prieſtly office.</p>

                  <p>THough Aaron, and the high Leviticall Prieſt, is ſaid to be the figure of Chriſt Jeſus, (the high Prieſt of our ſouls) yet our Saviour was not a Prieſt after the order of Aaron or Levi; neither was he of the Tribe of Levi. But Chriſt Jeſus was a Prieſt after the order of Melchiſedeck, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110 4. <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.17. Neither muſt we conceive that the Leviticall high Prieſt was the figure of our Saviour in all reſpects, as he was a Prieſt: For, though the ſacrifice of the brazen altar was offered and ſacrificed by the Leviticall high Prieſt himſelf; yet our Saviour did not offer and ſacrifice himſelf, prefigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate by that ſacrifice; though (out of his infinite love to man) our Saviour (patience it ſelf) did lay down his life, willingly and freely to be taken away by the bloody cruell hands of the wicked, incenſed by the malicious darkneſſe of the great Dragon: For, all the created powers of God could not have bereaved our Saviour of his life, without his own gracious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion. The Analogie therefore, between the Leviticall high Prieſt, and our Saviour, was in the Prieſthood (though not in every reſpect) and in the ſacrifice offered by the high Prieſt. And though the Analogie between the two ſacrifices be the chief point of this declaration; yet the Analogie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two high Prieſts muſt be firſt, (though briefly) declared. And next the Analogie between the two ſacrifices: The Leviticall high Prieſt did prefigurate the Prieſthood of Chriſt Jeſus, ſpecially in three reſpects: Firſt, both the high Prieſts did make atonement by the ſacrifice which was offered. The Leviticall high Prieſt morally, ceremonially, and temporally; Chriſt Ieſus ſpiritually and eternally. The ſecond reſpect was in the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of time, when the atonement was made. The Leviticall high Prieſt (beſide his morall and ceremoniall atonement) <hi>Exod.</hi> 30.9.10. did once a yeer (to wit) in the end of the yeer, enter the inner Tabernacle to make atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:49359:81"/> (at the Mercy-ſeat) both for his own actuall ſpirituall ſins, and for the actuall ſpirituall ſins of the people; by whoſe entring in the inner Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle once in the end of the yeer, the end of the prophetical obligement of the Law was prefigurate: But Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.28. did enter the Tabernacle not made with hands, but once in the end of the yeer (as it were) of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheticall ceremoniall obligement of the Law. And therefore Chriſt Jeſus is ſaid, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.10. to have entred but once for all: For, though the high Leviticall Prieſt, by the quotidian, and by the Sabbaticall ſacrifices, and ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remoniall commanded rites, did purge the tranſgreſſors of the morall and ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remoniall Law, morally and ceremonially, according to the command of the Law; yet, by the command of God by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>is Law, the high Prieſt was to enter the inner Tabernacle once a yeer, to obtain the pardon of actuall ſpirituall ſin at the Mercy-ſeat, whereby it was ſignified, that there is no pardon of actuall ſin, as it is ſpirituall, but by God himſelf only and immediately; and therefore the pardon was given to the high Prieſt immediatly in the behalf of the people, as he was the figure of the high Prieſt, Chriſt Jeſus to whom all power in heaven and in earth, is given by the ſacred Trinity. The third point of the Analogie between the high Prieſts, was, that as the Leviticall high Prieſt, before he entred the inner Tabernacle, (the holieſt place) firſt, he did ſacrifice the Holocauſt ſacrifice of the brazen altar, with the rites and ſervice belonging to that ſacrifice: as the offering up the ſweet inſence at the golden altar, kindled by the fire of the brazen altar, which came down from heaven; after the offering whereof, <hi>Levit.</hi> 16.3, 4. clothed with a white robe, beſprinkled with the blood of the ſacrifice of the brazen altar, and with ſweet inſence kindled with the ſame fire, the high Prieſt did enter the holieſt place: So our Saviour, after he was firſt offered in a ſacrifice upon the hard brazen curſed altar of the croſſe, clothed with the rich white robe of his Righteouſneſſe, beſprinkled with the precious blood of his own ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and with the odoriferous inſence thereof, did gloriouſly enter the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle, not made with hands, (by his infinit merit) to make eternall inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion and atonement at the Mercy-ſeat of Righteouſneſſe, for the myſticall members of his body, ſpiritually and indiviſibly united to their myſticall head, by his indiviſible love. As for the Analogie between the ſacrifice offered up by the Leviticall high Prieſt, and the ſacrifice prefigurate thereby, it did likewiſe conſiſt in three ſpeciall points: Firſt, as the blood of the Leviti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call ſacrifice of the brazen altar, was firſt ſhed, and then laid upon the brazen altar: So the ſacred blood of the Son of God was ſhed firſt by his crowning with a crown of ſharp prickly thornes, cauſing ſtreams of blood to beſmeare his glorious face and body. Secondly, by his cruell ſcourging, which was a
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:49359:82"/> moſt c uell kinde of bloody puniſhment, according to the manner of the Jews. Thirdly, by the flood of blood, by reaſon of the great boyſterous nails to hold his body faſt to the curſed altar of the croſſe, prefigurate by the bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen altar. The Analogie of the ſecond point between the two ſacrifices, was, that both was an Holocauſt, ſacrifice: For, as the Leviticall ſacrifice of of the brazen altar was wholy burnt up, and conſumed by the fire which came down from heaven; ſo the ſacrifice of the Lord of life, (as he is man) was burnt up, and conſumed by the fire of Gods wrath, which came down fr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>alogie of the two ſacrifices, was, <hi>Levit.</hi> 4.12. that as the aſhes of the whole burnt ſacrifice of the brazen altar was taken from the brazen altar, and carryed in aſh-pans, and laid apart from the altar, in a clean place: So the bleſſed body of our Saviour, <hi>Joh.</hi> 19.38, 39, 40, 41. was taken down from the curſed altar of the croſſe by Joſeph of Arimathea, Nicodemus, and others of that religious company, prefigurate by the aſh-pans, and carried and laid in a new ſepulchre, wherein no man was formerly laid. Becauſe the point of this declaration is in the ſacrifice of our bleſſed Saviour, the declaration thereof ſhall be diſcharged in theſe two heads: Firſt, our Saviours cruell curſed death, by the curſed altar of the croſſe, ſhall be declared: And ſecondly, the place where the Lord was laid, prefigurate by the aſhes of the ſacrifice of the brazen altar, which were carried apart from the altar, and laid in a clean place. Becauſe the ſacrifice of our Saviour is plainly ſet down in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, we will firſt, only make a brief and ſummary relation of the ſeverall paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges thereof; and next, certain myſticall concerning points ſhall be obſerved of the death and ſuffering of our Saviour. Of all the ſtratagems of Satan by his falſe deceiving bewitching light; his incenſing of miſerable men, with ſuch bloody cruell hands, to crucifie the Lord of life, was moſt admirable and ſtrange: For, firſt the power of actuall freedome, of naturall and morall g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ace, which they then enjoyed by the redemption of man from the curſe of the Law, by the eternall Decree of God, (though to be performed in time) was ſuch, as Satan, and all the created powers of God, could not neceſſitate the will of man to any morall evill; but that man muſt be willingly and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly led and induced to commit that evill. Secondly, the propheticall Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath was the glory of the Jews nation, whereby the Jews were ſo eminent, and had ſuch great preferment above all the nations of the earth, which glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and great preferment the Jews did then enjoy by faith in the bleſſing of the promiſed reſt of the bleſſed ſeed, propheſied by the propheticall Sabbath,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:49359:82"/> as it was the ſeventh day of the propheticall ceremoniall Law, which was then the immediate object of the Jews faith. And though our Saviour did manifeſt himſelf to the Jews, that he was that bleſſed ſeed, which was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied by the propheticall Sabbath, (ſhining then ſo gloriouſly amongſt the Jews) by his gracious light, leading them to his love, which was freely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended towards all, rich and poor, in his curing of all manner of ſenſitive incurable diſeaſes of the body, and the diſeaſed ſouls of many, engaging thereby ſo the generall love of all, that happy was he who could but touch the Lord of life; to none was his love and help denyed, who were led to him by this gracious light of the ſound of his Word, who by the power of his wonders and miracles, did manifeſt himſelf to be the Son of God, ingaging the reverend fear of all by the convincing power of whoſe wonders and miracles, the wretched Jews were conſtrained to acknowledge ſo much; yet that Satan (by his falſe deceiving light) ſhould notwithſtanding ſo induce the unthankfull Jews not to ſuppreſſe, but (with ſuch bloody hands) to extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh the light of their own eternall life and reſt, it cannot but amaze the heart of man; though all was by the hand of Gods permiſſive power: For, though the power of Satans falſe deceiving light be wonderfull, yet Satan with all his power, muſt work all his miſchief only by the betraying of the willing conſent of man, to have man to effect what he would; of whoſe help Satan himſelf did then ſtand in great need; for this miſerable act of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan was not ſo much out of his malice to man, as out of Satans own fear: For, by the greatneſſe of this glorious light of the promiſed bleſſed ſeed, Satan be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be afraid, that the head of his power muſt be broke by the ſeed of the woman; and therefore it did ſtand Satan in hand, in time to prevent this ſo great and eminent danger, which that falſe Serpent did by ſuggeſting ſuch a light of apparent fear to the Prieſts, Scribes, and Phariſees of the utter loſſe of their glorious Sabbath, and of the Leviticall dignity, means, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment, if they ſhould give way to this glorious light to ſhine amongſt them, whereby the world was ſo led and carried; by which falſe ſuggeſted fear of Satans falſe deceiving light, the Scribes and Phariſees, and the reſt of that rablement, were furiouſly incenſed with all greedy deſire, not to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe, but extinguiſh the light it ſelf, whereby both might reſt ſecure from any ſuch fear, which this barbarous crue did with moſt cruell bloody hands effect, though while their cruell hands were in externall action, their hearts were internally pricked with the power of this light, as may appear by the ſacred Hiſtory, from the firſt point to the laſt: For, firſt, while the Scribes and Pariſees did hire their Helhounds to apprehend the Lord of life, the Lord told the Helhounds, <hi>John</hi> 18.5, 6.12.13. that he was the man whom
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:49359:83"/> they did ſeek. And though by the power of his Word they fell back to the ground; yet up again, and to the Lord they went: And though Malcomes eare, <hi>Luke</hi> 22, 50, 51. (being ſtruck off) was miraculouſly cured by our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our; (a glim of the light of the reſt of their glorious Sabbath) yet ſuch was the power of the Devils darkneſſe, obſcuring that glorious light, as our bleſſed Saviour (like a malefactor) was haled to the judgement hall. And though Pilat (convinced by the power of this glorious light) did thrice pronounce the Lord innocent, yet Pilat, (led by Satans light) his tongue condemned the Lord of life. But Pilate, by hearing one of the murthering crue ſay, <hi>Joh.</hi> 19.7. that Chriſt affirmed himſelf to be the Son of God, Pilats heart (being prickt again by that word) ſought to ſet our Saviour at liberty; till another told Pilate, <hi>Joh.</hi> 19.12, 13. that if he ſhould do ſo, Pilat ſhould ſhew himſelf an enemy to Ceſar; at which words, Pilate fearing, by his letting of Chriſt go free, the loſſe of his place, if not his life; Pilate delivered the King of glory to the murtherers: For, the Scribes and Phariſees cryed out that they had a Law, and that by that Law, Chriſt ought to die, and there was a reaſon of right for all. Our Saviour therefore being delivered to the mercileſſe band; firſt, <hi>Mar.</hi> 15.15. he was cruelly ſcourged, a fearfull bloody puniſhment, and of no leſſe cruelty, according to the judiciall Law, uſed amongeſt the Jews: Secondly, his glorious head (in deriſion) <hi>Mar.</hi> 15.17. was crowned with a prickly crown of thornes, by the ſharp pricks whereof, ſtreams of his precious blood did beſmear his gracious face, and bleſſed body: Thirdly, being ſo bloodily crowned, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27.29. a reedy Scepter was put in his hand, (by their Apiſh geſtures) ſaluting the King of glory for the king of the Jews, though by right deſcent, Chriſt Jeſus was their King indeed: Fourthly, our Saviour was commanded (by the cruell torturors) <hi>John</hi> 19.17. to bear his croſſe, the curſe whereof he was to bear, both in ſoul and body: Fifthly, our Saviour was (with mercileſſe cruelty) nailed to the croſſe, and (moſt ignominiouſly) hanged between two notorious thieves: Sixtly, our Saviour thirſting (in the agony of his paſſion) <hi>Mat.</hi> 27.34.38. was offered the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter potion of vineger and gall to drink; ſo that all the ſenſitive powers of the Lord of life, the Son of God (as he is man) from his head to his body, hands and feet, were moſt cruelly and mercileſly martyred by the bloody murtherers, for the ſpace, from the ſixth hour to the ninth; though nothing to the martyrdome of his burned ſoul, burnt up by the fiery wrath of God from heaven, proceeding from the actuall inflicting of the curſe of the Law, to the ſuſtaining whereof, the Son of God, (as he is man) out of his love to man, did freely oblige himſelf by covenant. The ſuſtaining of which torture, upon the curſed altar of the croſſe, made our Saviour cry out, <hi>My God, my God,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:49359:83"/> why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> All which miſeries, (proceeding from the curſe of the law) the Lord of life, the eternall Son of God, God equall with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, (out of his infinite love to man) did predeſtinate himſelf, by his Decree from all eternity, to ſuffer, as he is man. And laſt of all, theſe bloody Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hounds, (that they might be ſure, that his glorious light might never ſhine again) <hi>John</hi> 19.34. did with a ſpear pierce the Lord of life to the heart, of which wound, iſſued blood and water. And ſo much for the brief ſummary relation of the ſacrifice of our Saviour, offered for man, condemned to the eternall curſe of the Law, whereby the Son of God, Chriſt Jeſus, out of his love to man, made himſelf a curſe for man, to redeem man from the curſe of the Law, for the ſin of Adam. Next, ſome myſticall concerning points are to be obſerved of the cruell martyrdome of our bleſſed Saviour.</p>

                  <p>FIrſt, by our Saviours coaction, to bear his croſſe, to which he was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinate, by the Decree of God from all eternity: The croſſe of afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his myſticall members, predeſtinate to be made like to the Image of his afflictions in this life, is myſtically ſignified: For, his myſticall members, as they are the Image of his afflictions, muſt participate with their myſticall head, and taſte of the cup which their myſticall head hath drunk, charged up to the brim; that as they have ſuffered with their myſticall head in this life, ſo they may raign in their head, crowned with an incorruptible Crown of glory, eternally in all heavenly happineſſe in the life to come: For, afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons is the ſtrait gate in this life, whereby his myſticall members muſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the kingdome of heaven. Secondly, by our Saviours thirſting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the curſed altar of the croſſe, while he was offered the bitter potion, of vineger and gall (by the torturing helhounds) to quench his thirſt, is myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally ſignified the eternall torments of the Reprobate in hell, burnt up with the actuall inflicting of the curſe of the Law in the full extent, by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming fire of Gods eternall wrath; who, while as they thirſt, no other li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor ſhall they have to quench their unquenchable thirſt, but the gally dregs of the Devils darkneſſe, with the voluptuous ſenſitive pleaſures whereof they did ſo ſurfet in this life. Thirdly, by the words of our Saviour (while he did endure and ſuſtain the curſe of the Law upon the curſed altar of the croſſe) ſaying, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> The extremity of his ſuſtaining of the wrath of God in the full extent, in the torturing of his ſoul, is myſtically ſignified, as the tortures of his ſenſitive body, by his
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:49359:84"/> ſenſitive martyrdome, was patient to all; whereby our Saviour did manifeſt himſelf true man to the world. Fouthly, by our Saviours words, (at the giving up of his Spirit) ſaying, <hi>John</hi> 19 30. <hi>It is finiſhed;</hi> was myſtically ſignified, that by his death; all the materiall altars and ſacrifices; all the figures, types, rites, and ceremonies, prefigurating the coming and death of the bleſſed ſeed, were all finiſhed and determined by his death, never to be reiterate in the Church of God. Fifthly, by the darkneſſe from the ſixth hour to the ninth, (which was the hour of his death) at which hour the darkneſſe vaniſhed, was myſtically ſignified, that all the cloudy darkneſſe of the propheticall ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remoniall Law, were quite vaniſhed away, never to be reiterate in the Church of God. Sixthly, by the rending of the vail of the Temple at Chriſts giving up of his Spirit, (which hath been formerly mentioned) the calling of the Gentiles, with the Jews in one Church, was myſtically ſignified; who upon the next day following, (to wit, upon the day of the Lords reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the grave) were all actually called in one Church by the new cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, to the great joy and comfort of all the nations of the world. Seventh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by the piercing of our Saviours heart with the ſpear, where the intellectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and ſenſitive ſpirits of man, (as he is man) are eſſentially united, It was myſtically ſignified again, that all the types, figures, and rites of the ceremoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Law, prefigurating our Saviours curſed death of the croſſe, from the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the world, were all pierced (as it were) to the heart, never to be rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate in the Evangelicall Church of God. Eighthly, by the blood and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, iſſuing from the wound of our Saviours heart, the ſacramentall ſeals of the new Teſtament, were myſtically ſignified: For, as in the ſacrament of Baptiſme, by the ſacramentall water, the water of eternall life is ſignified, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting the water iſſuing from our Saviours wounded heart, accompanied with his heart blood, whereby the baptized's actuall ſins are ſignified to be waſhed away, and whereby the baptized is raiſed from his death in actuall ſin, to the new life of ſaith; to let the baptized, and all men underſtand, that actuall ſin is waſhed away by our Saviours heart blood, which was accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with the water iſſuing from his wounded heart; and therefore it is ſaid by the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.6. <hi>This is he that came by water, not by water only; but by water and blood.</hi> So in the ſacrament of the Lords Supper, by the ſacramentall bread, the bread of eternall life is ſignified, as by the ſacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall wine our Saviours heart blood is ſignified; whereby the bread of life is purchaſed, to let all men underſtand, that the new life of faith is fed and nouriſhed by the bread of life, purchaſed by his ſacred blood; which bread of life is the Word, bleſſed and ſanctified by the Lords infinite merit, in the ſpirituall underſtanding whereof is eternall life, according to our Saviours

                  <head type="sub">The reaſon that Chriſt is called a Prieſt after the order of Melchiſedeck; and the execution of Chriſts Kingly office, while he was upon earth.</head>
                  <p>THe Queſtion moved in the former Chapter, is commonly anſwered, that the Reaſon, that Chriſt is ſaid to be a Prieſt after the order of Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſedeck, is, that as Melchiſedeck was without father or mother; So Chriſt, as he is man, is without a naturall father, naturally deſcended of Adam; and as he is God, Chriſt is without a mother. But this point is warily to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived: For, though it be ſaid, that Melchiſedeck was without father or mother, we muſt underſtand the words in this ſenſe; that Melchiſedeck was without any known father and mother; for his parents are concealed by the Scripture, not that we ſhould conceive that Melchiſeck was not man, natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally deſcended of Adam, but for another reaſon which ſhall be ſhewed; neither muſt we conceive, that there was any ſuch ſacrifice offered by Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſedeck, as was offered by our Saviour: For, Melchiſedeck could offer no other manner of ſenſitive ſacrifice, then the ſacrifice of the Altar, which was commanded by the propheticall Sabbath. But Chriſt Jeſus is ſaid to be a Prieſt for ever after the order of Melchiſedeck, in reſpect of the eternity of the Prieſt; for Melchiſedeck having neither known father or mother, or kindred; Melchiſedeck is ſaid to be without beginning or ending, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently his Prieſtly office: For, there was no lineall ſucceſſion of the Prieſtly office, till it was eſtabliſhed in the Tribe of Levi, which did only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, during the formall propheticall ceremoniall obligement of the Law.
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:49359:85"/> Before which time the Prieſthood was in private Families: Of this lately declared, I infer theſe three neceſſary demonſtrative concluſions: Firſt, the Apoſtles, and Apoſtolicall ſucceſſors, are not Prieſts, or to be called Prieſts, either after the order of Melchiſedeck, or after the order of Levi: For, firſt, they can be no Prieſts, or called Prieſts after the order of Melchiſedeck; for ſo their Prieſthood muſt be for ever: Secondly, they can be no Prieſts, or cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Prieſts after the order, or by the name of Levi; for ſo they muſt be cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall ſenſitive Prieſts, by offering of ceremoniall ſenſitive ſacrifices and gifts, ſtill prefigurating the curſed death of our Saviour, whereby the truth of his fulfilled promiſe of the bleſſed ſeed, is belied and denied.</p>
                  <p>Againſt this it is objected: Our Saviour in the inſtitution of the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his laſt Supper, before his death (as he is high Prieſt, after the order of Melchiſedeck,) did by this bleſſing of the bread and wine, change and tranſubſtanciate the ſubſtance of the bread and wine in the reall ſubſtance of his body and blood, and did offer up his reall body and blood (under the externall forms of bread and wine) in a propitiatory ſenſitive ſacrifice to his Father, for the dead, and for the quick; which ſacrifice is really one with his ſacrifice of the croſſe, after the offering up whereof, he did give his ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed reall body and blood (under the externall forms of bread and wine) to his Apoſtles, for the ſacrament of his laſt Supper, commanding the Apoſtles (and in the Apoſtles the Apoſtolicall ſucceſſors) to offer up his reall body and blood in a propitiatory ſenſitive ſacrifice, for the dead and for the quick. And after the offering up thereof, to give his ſacrificed reall body and blood, for the ſacrament of his laſt Supper to the communicants. The Apoſtles therefore, and the Apoſtolicall ſucceſſors, (by the power and authority of his command) are ſtill ceremoniall Prieſts, and muſt offer this propitiatory ſenſitive ſacrifice at the materiall Altar, for the quick and for the dead, under the externall forms of bread and wine.</p>
                  <p>The queſtion therefore here, is not of any metaphoricall ſacrifice, or of the ſpirituall ſacrifice of the Lords myſticall members, commanded to be offered at the ſpirituall Altar of righteouſneſſe; but of a proper reall ſenſitive pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiatory ſacrifice: Firſt, I anſwer to the affirmed propitiatory ſacrifice of our Saviours reall body and blood, which is pretended to be offered up by our Saviour, under the externall forms of bread and wine in the inſtitution of the ſacrament of his laſt Supper before his death, which is the main ground of the objection. Secondly, I anſwer to the affirmed reall unity of this pretended ſacrifice with our Saviours ſacrifice of the croſſe: As for the firſt, it is manifeſt, both by the truth of the ſacred Hiſtory, and by the very words of the inſtitution of the ſacrament of the Lords Supper, (before his
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:49359:85"/> death) that our Saviour did neither offer; nor intended to offer his reall body and blood (in the inſtitution of the ſacrament of his laſt Supper) in a propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory ſacrifice (under the externall forms of bread and wine) for the quick and f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>r the dead, as is falſly pretended, contrary to all truth of the Evangelicall Hiſtory: For, as our Saviour (while he was perſonally upon earth) having execute his propheticall office, by delivering to his Diſciples his laſt Will and Teſtament by his ſacred Word; ſealed by the ſacramentall ſeal of bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing, which was to ſucceed in the Church in place of the ſacrament of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion: So our Saviour (at the feaſt of the laſt Paſſeover) being the next day, to diſcharge his Prieſtly office, as he is High Prieſt after the order of Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſedeck, by his ſacrifice of the croſſe, whereby his promiſe of the bleſſed ſeed was to be fulfilled; our Saviour before his death, did likewiſe ſeal his laſt Will and Teſtament, with the inſtitution of the ſacrament of his laſt Supper to ſucceed in place of the ſacrament of the Paſſeover, though not to be (in force, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9 17.) till after the Teſtators death and reſurrection according to the Scripture; which Sacrament was not inſtitute till the night before his death of the croſſe; (in the end of the feaſt of the laſt Paſſeover) and that for theſe two main fundamentall reaſons: The firſt is, that by the inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sacrament of the Lords Supper (implying his whole laſt Will and new Teſtament) the Diſciples might underſtand, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10 9. that the ſacrament of the Paſſeover, (which is the ſacrament of the old Teſtament, implying the whole propheticall ceremoniall Law) was actually determined. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond reaſon, that the Sacrament of the Lords Supper was not inſtitute, till the night before his ſuffering was, that the Diſciples faith might be ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened againſt the ſore temptation wherby they were to be aſſaulted the next day, by our Saviours martyrdome, in ſuſtaining the fearfull curſe of the Law, by the curſed ſacrifice of the croſſe: For, though the Sacrament was inſtituted before our Saviours death; yet it is expreſſed in words of the preterit time: This my body which is given for you; this my blood which is ſhed for you; as if all had then been done and paſt, and as if our Saviour had been then dead, and riſen from the dead, which was a main reaſon to ſtrengthen the Diſciples faith in the Lords reſurrection; though they did ſee him dead and buried. And therefore our Saviour that night, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.31. did put the Diſciples upon their guard, telling them, that the Shepheard muſt be ſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten that night, and the ſheep ſcattered; yet comforting them withall, that he ſhould riſe again, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.32. and go before them into Galilee. By the truth of this relation of the ſacred Hiſtory, the judicious Reader may mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly perceive, that there was not the leaſt intent in our Saviour, (by the inſtitution of the Sacrament of his laſt Supper, before his death) to ſhed ſo
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:49359:86"/> much as a drop of his precious blood, much leſſe to offer his reall body and blood in a propitiatory ſacrifice for the dead, and for the quick, by his death, which he was to do the next day after, by his curſed ſacrifice of the croſſe, as he is high Prieſt, after the order of Melchiſedeck. Next, to make the falſhood of this aſſertion appear as plainly to the Reader, by the very words of the inſtitution of the Sacrament of the Lords Supper: Our Saviour (in the end of the laſt Paſſeover) by preſcribing the manner of the celebration of the Sacrament of his laſt Supper to the Diſciples, (which is by bleſſing and thankſ-giving) <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.26, 27. having bleſſed, took the bread and brake it, (to wit) the bread, and gave it, (to wit) the bread to the Diſciples, ſaying, <hi>Take, eat, this is my body;</hi> that is, this bread is my body of the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which is given for you, to wit, as the fleſh of the Paſcall Lamb was my promiſed body of the old Teſtament, which was promiſed to be given and broken for you. Alſo (having given thanks) he took the cup, (to wit) with the wine, and gave it, (to wit) the wine to them, ſaying, <hi>This is my blood of the new Teſtament, which is ſhed for you;</hi> that is, this wine is my blood of the new Teſtament, as the reall blood of the Paſcall Lamb, was my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed blood of the old Teſtament which was promiſed to be ſhed; but not to be drunk by any; <hi>Drink ye all of it,</hi> that is, of this wine: And leſt there ſhould be any miſtake in the word Wine, (which our Saviour calls his blood of the new Teſtament, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.28.) he doth after (in plain terms) call it the fruit of the Vine, ſaying, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26, 29. <hi>I will not drink henceforth of the fruit of the vine, untill that day, when I ſhall drink it with you in my Fathers Kingdome;</hi> which is meaned of the Evangelicall day of the Kingdome of Grace (to wit) the Lords Day; whereby the Lord (by his reſurrection and reſt from the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of his promiſe of the bleſſed ſeed) did open the kingdome of Heaven to all Believers, leading all men by the light of his Day, to lay the hands of faith upon his merit; whereby all Believers are made heirs of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Grace in this life, and of the kingdome of Heaven, in the life to come, whoſe gracious merit is that bread of eternall life, ſignified by the bread of the Sacrament; as by the breaking of the bread, the breaking of our Saviours body by the curſe of the croſſe; and by the wine, the ſhedding of his precious blood is ſignified, whereby he did merit the bread of eternall life. Our Saviour therefore, by the inſtitution of the Sacrament of his laſt Supper, did deliver to his Apoſtles, and in the Apoſtles to the Apoſtolicall ſucceſſors the formall Sacrament of his laſt Will, and new Teſtament; and conſequently not the reall ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="163" facs="tcp:49359:86"/> Lords Supper, cannot be his formall ſacrifice of the croſſe; ſo can neither his formall ſenſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>te ſenſes, which is the Lords merit, by his curſed death of the croſſe, by his bloody reſt in the grave, and by his reſurrection from the grave to be apprehended by the hands of faith, while by our Saviours ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of the croſſe, not the immediate, but the mediate object of faith, is (by the mediate ſenſes) preſented to the underſtanding; which mediate ſenſitive object (by interveening between the faith of man, and the Lords merit) faith and the immediate object are ſeparate, whereby the faith of man is overthrown. And this is the reaſon, that all Imagery, painted or carved, of our Saviour, (as he is man) implying his death and humility, are condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for Idolatry, as hath been formerly declared. No ſuch ſurmiſed ſacrifice therefore being offered by our Saviour in his inſtitution of the Sacrament of his laſt Supper; no command was given to the Apoſtles, to offer any ſuch fictious ſacrifice; and conſequently the Apoſtles and the Apoſtolicall ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors; (the Miniſters of the Word and Sacraments) no commanded Prieſts to offer any ſuch fictious ſenſitive ſacrifice, at the materiall altar, as is falſly pretended by the objection. Next, I anſwer to the affirmed reall unity of this pretended imaginary ſacrifice with our Saviours ſacrifice of the croſſe. Leaving the Philoſophicall diſtinction of unity, as genericall, ſperificall, udo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mericall, reall, formall, and ſuch like. In this encounter, I take the two laſt diſtinctions of unity (Theologically) to wit, one really, and one formally. This affirmed unity therefore, of the two ſacrifices, cannot be formall; and therefore it muſt be reall. This affirmed reall unity therefore, of the two ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, is all one to ſay, as that our Saviour (in the inſtitution of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his laſt Supper, by offering of his reall body and blood, under the externall forms of bread and wine in a propitiatory ſacrifice for the dead and for the quick) did as really and in effect, ſuſtain the curſe of the Law in the full extent, by the curſed death of ſoul and body, as he did by his curſed ſacrifice of the croſſe; which fearfull aſſertion is repugnant to the truth of all Chriſtian faith: For, by this affirmed reall unity of the two ſacrifices, theſe ſubſequent inevitable concluſions muſt neceſſarily follow. Firſt, by this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed reall unity of the two ſacrifices, the firſt ſurmiſed propitiatory ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, (pretended to be offered by our Saviour) muſt be a curſed ſacrifice: For, ſuch was our Saviours ſacrifice of the croſſe, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13. And conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, our Saviours ſacrificed reall body and blood (which is pretended to be given to the Apoſtles) curſed, which is higheſt blaſphemy to affirm.
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:49359:87"/> Secondly, by the affirmed reall unity of theſe two ſacrifices, the pretended propitiatory ſacrifice (affirmed to be offered by our Saviour, in the inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the Sacrament of his laſt Supper,) muſt be a ſenſitive reall bloody ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice; for there is no propitiatory ſacrifice for ſin, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.22. without the ſenſitive blood of the ſacrificed; for ſuch was our Saviours propitiatory ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of the croſſe: But the propugnators of this ſurmiſed propitiatory ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, will acknowledge no ſenſitive reall blood in their ſacrifice; and therefore they muſt acknowledge this pretended propitiatory ſacrifice to be no propitiatory ſacrifice. Thirdly, by the affirmed, reall unity of theſe two ſacrifices; this ſurmiſed pretended ſacrifice (affirmed to be offered by our Saviour) muſt be a deadly ſacrifice, by the ſenſitive death of the ſacrificed, for ſuch was our Saviours ſacrifice of the croſſe: But the propagnators of this ſurmiſed ſacrifice, muſt acknowledge no ſuch ſenſitive death of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our (by the inſtitution of the Sacrament of his laſt Supper,) and therefore, they muſt acknowledge their pretended ſacrifice to be no ſacrifice. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by the reall affirmed unity of theſe two ſacrifices; the only one ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of our Saviour by the death of the croſſe, as be is high Prieſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the order of Melchiſedeck, once offered for all, is plainly denied: For, by this affirmed reall unity of the two ſacrifices, our Saviour died twice. Fifthly, by the affirmed reall unity of the two ſacrifices, the firſt ſurmiſed pretended ſacrifice is a falſe ſacrifice: For by the adoration of this imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary ſacrifice, the truth of the Lords commanded worſhip (by the Lords Day) is contradicted, which is commanded to be celebrate in ſpirit and truth, and not in the adoration of ſuch a falſe ſacrifice. Sixthly, by the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed reall uni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>y of theſe two ſacrifices; the firſt pretended ſacrifice is a faithleſſe ſacrifice: For, by this pretended ſacrifice, the faith of man, and the immediate object of faith, (which is the Lords merit) are actually ſeparate. Seventhly, by the reall affirmed unity of theſe two ſacrifices, the pretended ſacrifice affirmed to be offered by our Saviour, in the inſtitution of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of his laſt Supper, is an Idolatrous ſacrifice: For, by the adoring of this ſacrifice, the ſenſitive object doth interveen between the Lord and his immediate commanded worſhip. Eighthly, by the reall affirmed unity of theſe two ſacrifices; Chriſt was really dead before his laſt Will and Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was ſealed by the ſacrament of his laſt Supper, implying the whole Evangel and new Teſtament, and conſequently his laſt Will and Teſtament no Will. Ninthly, by the affirmed reall unity of theſe two ſacrifices; man was actually redeemed from the curſe of the Law for the ſin of Adam, and the Law was fulfilled for man by our Saviour before his death of the croſſe, before his bloody reſt in the grave, and before his reſurrection from the dead.
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:49359:87"/> Tenthly, by this affirmed reall unity of the two ſacrifices; all the propheſies prophcying of the bleſſed ſeed (from the foundation of the world) were ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled before our Saviours death, by the curſed altar of the croſſe, and reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection from the dead. Eleventhly, by this affirmed reall unity of the two ſacrifices; all the types, rites, figures and ceremonies, prefigurating the death of the bleſſed ſeed from the foundation of the world, were actually determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, by the firſt pretended ſacrifice, which all the ſacrifices of all the creatures of God could never determine, till they were all actually determined by our Saviours laſt breath upon the curſed altar of the croſſe, while as he ſaid, <hi>It is finiſhed.</hi> The twelfth concluſion doth neceſſarily follow from the former three: For, by the affirmed reall unity of the two ſacrifices, our Saviours death by the curſed altar of the croſſe, was ſuperfluous. Thirteenthly, by the affirmed reall unity of theſe two ſacrifices, this firſt ſurmiſed ſacrifice (pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be offered by our Saviour in the inſtitution of the ſacrament of his laſt Supper) muſt be a reall Holocauſt ſacrifice, curſed and burnt up by the fiery conſuming wrath of God for ſin; no part or portion whereof muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main to be given to the Apoſtles; for ſuch was our Saviours ſacrifice of the croſſe, prefigurate by the Holocauſt ſacrifice of the brazen altar.</p>
                  <p>Hence I neceſſarily inferre, that by this affirmed reall unity the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Lords Supper is falſly denied to be given to the Apoſtles; for by this pretended ſurmiſed ſacrifice, our Saviours reall ſacrificed body and blood (which in this caſe profiteth nothing) <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.63. is affirmed to be given to the Apoſtles as a ſacrament; while as in the ſacrament of the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, by the ſacramentall bread and wine (given by our Saviour to the Apoſtles) the bread of eternall life, purchaſed by his ſacrificed reall body and blood, is ſignified to be given. By the faithfull receiving whereof, God in his Son Chriſt Jeſus, dwelleth in the heart of man by his love; and man by faith in the love of God, which is the only means whereby a man knoweth himſelf to ſtand in the ſtate of Grace, whereof no man can be ever aſſured, till he find his love ſuch to the truth of the Lords love by his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit (implying the truth of the whole Evangell and Law of God) as neither all the hopefull preferments of this life, nor all the threatned dangers of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall death it ſelf can move him to deny the truth of that merit; and this is that faith which our Saviour ſaith, is able to remove the greateſt moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of temptation. By the reall affirmed unity therefore of theſe two ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, all Chriſtian faith is raſed from the foundation. And ſo much for anſwer to the objection: And for the declaration of our Saviours ſacrifice, by his death of the croſſe: we are next to return to the place where the Lord was laid. But becauſe the main point doth conſiſt in the Declaration of the
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:49359:88"/> new covenant, immediatly depending upon the Lords reſurrection from the grave, which we muſt no wayes interrupt: We will therefore firſt, briefly in a word, ſet down the diſcharge of our Saviours kingly office upon earth, prefigurate by Melchiſedeck, and then come to the declaration of the place where the Lord was laid. Melchiſedeck was the figure of Chriſt, as he was Prieſt, Prophet, and King: And though we reade not of any Propheſie of Melchiſedeck; yet Melchiſedeck, as he was Prieſt, in diſcharging of the Prieſtly office, did neceſſarily propheſie: For, by the Prieſts ceremoniall exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of the ſacrifice of the altar, and of the rites of the propheticall Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath; the Prieſt did neceſſarily propheſie. And this is the reaſon, that Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Luke</hi> 11.50, 51. that the Law and the Prophets did propheſie from Abel, which is chiefly meant by the Prieſtly office. And therefore it is ſaid, that Caiphas did propheſie the death of our bleſſed Saviour, as high Prieſt that yeer, ſaying, <hi>Joh.</hi> 11.49, 50, 51, 52. <hi>Ye perceive nothing, neither do ye conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that it is expedient that one man die, then the whole nation ſhould periſh.</hi> Though Caiphas did propheſie out of his fear of the overthrow of the Prieſtly prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; yet his propheſie was no other indeed, then the propheſie of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheticall Sabbath. As Melchiſedeck therefore did prefigurate our Saviour, as he was Prieſt and Prophet; ſo Melchiſedeck did prefigurate Chriſt Jeſus as he was King: For, Melchiſedeck was king of peace and righteouſneſſe; and ſo he was the true type and figure of our Saviour, <hi>Exod.</hi> 25.11. whoſe regall authority was ſignified by the golden crown placed above the ark of the Covenant, compaſſing the cherubims, overſhadowing with their wings the Mercy-ſeat. The diſcharge of our Saviours Kingly authority upon earth, was chiefly in theſe three reſpects: Firſt, Chriſt Jeſus, by the infinite act of his own immediate power, by his reſurrection from the grave, in his reſting from the work of the redemption, did, as a royall King, redeem his ſubjects, (to wit) Adam, and all men naturally deſcended, and to deſcend of Adam, from the captivity of ſin, Satan, eternall death, and darkneſſe, from the curſe of the Law, to which all men were condemned for the ſin of Adam. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, our Saviour, as he is King of Peace, did reconcile all men to the love and favour of God, by removing of the wrath of God from all men for the ſin of Adam. Thirdly, Chriſt Jeſus, as he is King of Righteouſneſſe, out of his Kingly authority, did command all his ſubjects of the world, (thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed) to the obedience of his Law of righteouſneſſe of faith upon the twofold reward of his Law by his new covenant. And ſo much briefly, for the diſcharge of our Saviours Kingly office upon earth. We do therefore now return to the Declaration of the ſecond part of the ſacrifice of our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Saviour, (the high Prieſt, after the order of Melchiſedeck) and to the
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:49359:88"/> Declaration of the place where the Lord was laid after his cruell bloody death, prefigurate by the aſhes of the ſacrifice, and the clean place where the aſhes were laid apart from the Altar.</p>

And though by this tragicall bloody per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution of the Shepherd, the ſheep were ſcattered, yet Joſeph of Arimathea, one of Chriſts Diſciples, and a man of note and worth, with honeſt Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demus, and others of that religious company, out of the loyalty of their love to our Saviour, did gracefully intomb his gracious body in a new tomb, hewn out of a rock, wherein no man was formerly laid.

<pb n="168" facs="tcp:49359:89"/> did reſt from the fulfilling of the promiſe of the bleſſed ſeed, both which reſts were myſticall. The myſterie of his bloody reſt is twofold: The firſt my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie is in the propheticall covenant, and in the laſt Sabbath obliged by the covenant: For, as the eternall Word did oblige Adam, and all men naturally to deſcend of Adam to believe his promiſed reſt of the bleſſed ſeed, to reſt upon the laſt Sabbath, from the redemption of man from the curſe of the Law (propheſied by the propheticall Sabbath) to whoſe beliefe the bleſſing of his promiſed reſt was due by the Law: So he, graciouſly and freely, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged himſelf to man, to redeem man from the curſe of the Law for the ſin of Adam, and to redeem all which was loſt by that ſin, and conſequently to redeem the bleſſing of the firſt ſeventh dayes reſt, loſt by Adam, which was the bleſſing of his promiſed reſt by the propheticall Sabbath; all which he graciouſly performed by his bloody reſt in the grave upon the laſt Sabbath: For, our Saviour upon the laſt Sabbath, did reſt from the redemption of man, from the curſe of the Law for the ſin of Adam: And by his reſting (in his ſacred grave) for the whole ſpace of the laſt Sabbath, (our Saviour in the ſeventh day, having fulfilled the whole Law, as he was obliged to the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of the Law, in the promiſe of the bleſſed ſeed) the eternall reſt of the firſt ſeventh day, (loſt by Adam) was due by the Law of God, to the merit of his bloody ſeventh dayes reſt; where three main fundamentall points of faith are preciſely to be obſerved by the juditious Reader.</p>
                  <p>The firſt point is, that the laſt Sabbath, (whereon our Saviour did reſt in his ſacred grave after his death) was no wayes propheticall: For, all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies, prophecying the birth and death of the bleſſed ſeed, from the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the world, were all fulfilled and determined by our Saviours bloody reſt upon this laſt Sabbath; by whoſe bloody reſt in his grave, for the ſpace of the whole laſt Sabbath, from end to end, the Law was fulfilled for man. And this is the reaſon that our Saviour ſaid, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.17. that he came to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill the Law.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond point of faith is, that no man naturally to deſcend of Adam, was obliged to fulfill the command of the Law by this laſt Sabbath: For, Chriſt Jeſus only, (the Son of God, as he is man, begot of the ſeed of the woman) was only obliged to fulfill the command of the ſeventh day, by the laſt Sabbath, as he graciouſly obliged himſelf by the propheticall covenant.</p>
                  <p>The third point of faith is, that Adam, and all men naturally to deſcend of Adam, were only obliged to fulfill the command of the ſeventh day of the propheticall Sabbath. And therefore Chriſt Jeſus being born under the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheticall Law, (obliged by the propheticall Sabbath) was circumciſed the eighth day, and did obſerve other ceremonies of the Law, as other men did:
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:49359:89"/> For though our Saviour did not naturally deſcend of Adam, yet he did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend of the ſeed of Adam, according to the fleſh.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond myſtery of his bloody reſt was, that by his bloody reſt, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe renewed to Abraham was fulfilled: which was the ſame reall promiſe firſt made to Adam, though renewed to Abraham, after a more cleere and particular manner, which promiſe, had two branches. The firſt was, that the bleſſed ſeed (according to the fleſh) ſhould deſcend of the ſeed of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, which promiſe was prefigurate, firſt, by the glorious light of the Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Candleſtick, by the table of ſhew-bread (ſignifying the life, which was in that light) wherby the bleſſed ſeed, (who is light and life to deſcend of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams ſeed) was prefigurate. Secondly, by the ſweet inſence burned, upon the Golden Altar, the appeaſing of Gods wrath, by the bleſſed ſeed, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend of Abraham was prefigurate: all which were placed in the holy place of the Tabernacle. The ſecond branch of the promiſe made to Abraham, was, that in Abrahams ſeed, all the nations of the earth ſhould bee bleſſed; which was likewiſe prefigurate, by the ſacrifice of the brazen Altar. For at our Saviors giving up of his laſt ſpirit (upon the curſed altar of the croſſe) the vaile of the Temple was rent from the top to the bottom: within which vaile (which was the holieſt place) was the Arke, with the word therin, and the Golden Crowne, the Cherubint (covering with their wings the mercy-ſeat) prefigurating the conception of our Saviour, of the ſeed of the woman; wherby the firſt promiſe made to Adam was ſignified. Now the vaile of the Temple being rent aſunder (by the power of our Saviours death) the firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe made to Adam, was laied open, and made patent, both to the Jewes, and Gentiles, who were mutually called the next day by the new covenant, which was the day of Chriſts reſurrection. Now the new covenant being made, with all the nations of the world, the promiſe made to Abraham (that all the nations of the earth ſhould be bleſſed in his ſeed) was fulfilled. And ſo much for the twofold myſtery of our Saviours bloody reſt.</p>
                  <p>The myſtery of his joyfull Evangellicall reſt, did conſiſt in theſe two maine fundamentall points of faith. The firſt was, by his reſurrection from the grave, wherby our Saviour, by his triumphant victory, over ſin, Satan, eternall dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and death, the curſe of the Law, and the grave, (by the infinit act of his owne immediate power (did manifeſt himſelfe Truth to man (in his faithfull fulfilling of his promiſed reſt of the bleſſed ſeed (and in that Truth, Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt God and man, in the three coeſſentiall diſtinct perſons, of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Trinity [God] by the infinit act of his owne immediate power, [Man] begotten of the father of the ſeed of the woman, by the immediate act of the holy ſpirit, in the eſſentiall union of his divine and humane nature, implied
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:49359:90"/> in the word [Lord] which is the ſacred name, of the eſſentiall union, of the divine and humane nature, of the Lord of life, comprehending, both the names of Jeſus, and Chriſt, afterwards to be declared. For though Jeſus Chriſt as he is the Son of God (begotten man of the ſeed of the woman) did performe his bloody reſt: Yet his Evangelicall reſt (by his reſting from the fulfilling of the Law, implying his reſt from the redemption of man) was performed by our Saviour as he is Lord, Jeſus, Chriſt, God, equall with the Father and holy Spirit, in whom the Godhead dwelleth bodily. And therfore the day of his reſurrection is called the Lords day.</p>
                  <p>In the ſecond point of the myſtery, of the Lords Evangelicall reſt, doth ſtand the very period of the myſtery of the Lords day: for man naturally deſcended of Ada<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, being only obliged, to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand of the ſeventh day of the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Sabbath, and no waies to the ſeventh day of the laſt Sabbath (to which man Chriſt Jeſus only was obliged) the day of our Saviours reſurrection from the grave (the Lords day) doth fall out to be, the juſt ſeventh day, from the laſt formall propheticall Jewes Sabbath, ſtill obliging man to the ſeventh day of the Law. Though by including, the laſt formall propheticall Jewes Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, in the account, the Lords day is the eight day, as it was prefigurate by the eight day of the Sacrament of circumciſion. To the adminiſtration wherof the great propheticall Sabbath, did neceſſarily give place, wherby the Lords day, was myſtically prefigurate, to ſucceed, in place of the Jewes propheticall Sabbath. The day of our Saviours reſurrection therefore, being the next day immediatly ſucceeding the laſt Sabbath (wheron our Saviour reſted in his ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred grave) is the juſt ſeventh day of the Law, from the laſt formall propheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Jewes Sabbath: As man naturally deſcended of Adam, is obliged to the command of the ſeventh day of the Law of God, implying the command of the whole Law. The Lords day therefore (the day of the Lords reſurrection from the grave) is the true ſeventh day of the Evangelicall Law of God, decreed by God from all eternity. Where three fundamentall points of faith are neceſſarily to bee obſerved by the Chriſtian Reader. Firſt, as the firſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day of the Law, was bleſſed &amp; ſanctified, by the Lords reſt from the workes of the creation. And as the next ſeventh day of the propheticall Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, was bleſſed and ſanctified by the truth of the word of the Lords promiſed reſt, in the promiſe of the bleſſed ſeede, to reſt upon the laſt Sabbath from the redemption of man, from the curſe of the Law, for the ſinne of Adam. So the Lords day (the ſeventh day of the Evangelicall Law of faith) is bleſſed and ſanctified, by the truth of the Lords fulfilled promiſe, by his Evangelicall reſt. The laſt period of whoſe fulfilled promiſe, was in his conqueſt of his laſt enemy, by his reſurrection from the power of the grave upon the Lords
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:49359:90"/> day. Whereby the Lord reſted from the fulfilling of his promiſe, of the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſeed. By the power of whoſe infinit merit (by his Evangelicall reſt) the Lords day is the bleſſed and ſanctified ſeventh day of the Evangelicall Law, the word of eternall life &amp; reſt, and the immediate object of Chriſtian faith.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, as the ſeventh day of the propheticall Sabbath, was immediatly commanded by the power of the Lords word (by his promiſed reſt) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding Adam and the Fathers, to beleeve in the truth of his merit, by his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed reſt, which was then propheſied, by the word of the propheticall Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, commanding the ceremoniall worſhip of the Sabbath immediatly, as it was the ſeventh day of the propheticall Law, and in the ſeventh day the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of man to the command of the whole propheticall Law, by faith in the promiſe of the bleſſed ſeed: to whoſe faith the eternall bleſſing of the Lords promiſed Sabbaticall reſt was due by the propheticall Law. So the Lords day is immediatly commanded, by the power of his immediate word, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding all the nations of the world, to beleeve the truth of his fulfilled pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe by his ſeventh daies Evangelicall reſt, as the Lords day is the ſeventh day of the Evangelicall Law, implying the command of the whole Law, firſt &amp; immediatly commanding, the ſeventh daies worſhip by faith in the truth of the Lords fulfilled promiſe, to whoſe faith the bleſſing of the Lords merit, by his Evangelicall reſt is due by the Evangelicall Law of faith, which is the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the Lords day. This is therefore the howre and bleſſed day, which the Lord told the Samaritan woman, ſhould come, when God ſhould be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhiped, <hi>In ſpirit and truth:</hi> that is in the ſpirit of faith, in the truth of the Lords fulfilled promiſe. Thirdly, as by the light of the propheticall Sabbath day Adam and the Fathers, were literally lead, to the bleſſing of the Lords promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed reſt. So by the light of the Lords day, all the nations of the world are li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terally lead, to the bleſſing of the Lords merit by the truth of his fulfilled pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe. Whoſoever therefore doth denie the light of the truth of the Lords day (ſealed by the precious blood of his bleſſed heart) doth neceſſarily denie the Lord, truth it ſelfe.</p>
                  <p>By this opening of the myſtery of the Lords day, bleſſed &amp; ſanctified by his Evangelicall reſt (neceſſarily implying his bloody reſt) the judicious Reader may eaſily perceive the reaſon of the miſtake, of the lords day: the only cauſe of which miſtake, is in the miſtaking of the laſt Sabbath, for the formall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheticall Jewes Sabbath: which was no waies the Jewes propheticall Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, neither was either Jew or Gentile, obliged to the command of this laſt Sabbath: or had any hand in the fulfilling of the command of this laſt Sabbath being too hard and impoſſible a task for man as he is man. Let us leave there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the command of this laſt Sabbath, to the Lord of the Sabbath, who as he (did
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:49359:91"/> in his great mercy) oblige himſelfe, to the obedience of the command of this laſt Sabbath: ſo (in his love and mercy to man) the Lord graciouſly fulfilled the command thereof for man. Let us leave I ſay this laſt Sabbath to the Lord of the Sabbath (who was only obliged to the command of this laſt Sabbath, as it is the ſeventh day of the Law, obliging the Lord himſelfe as he is man) and we ſhall have the Lords day the juſt ſeventh day of the Evangelicall Law, as the Law of God obligeth man, naturally deſcended of Adam. And this is properly the Sabbath, whereby the Lord is intituled, Lord of the Sabbath. And the Sabbath (properly) that the Lord ſaith was made for man. For by the Lords fulfilling of this laſt Sabbath (by his bloody reſt) the Lord reſted from his curſed death of the Croſſe for the redemption of man; and by his bloody reſt in the grave did merit the eternall reſt loſt by Adam. By whoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection from the grave, the Lord did triumphantly and Evangelically reſt from the fulfilling of his promiſe of the bleſſed ſeed. This twofold reſt of the eternall word ariſing from the laſt myſticall Sabbath, was prefigurate, by a twofold type and figure. Of which twofold type and figure next.</p>

                  <head type="sub">The twofold type and figure whereby the laſt Sabbath was prefigurate.</head>
                  <p>THe laſt Sabbath according to the myſticall ſenſe was prefigurate, by a twofold type and figure. Firſt the fulfilling of this Sabbath was prefigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, by the bleſſed Virgin. Secondly, by the yeare of Jubile. Firſt therefore of the prefigurating thereof, by the bleſſed Virgin. As by the Arke, with the word placed therein, and the Cherubins overſhadowing the Mercie-ſeat, the bleſſed Virgin was prefigurate, from her conception of the bleſſed ſeed till her delivery of the bleſſed Child. So by the beſſed Virgin, the reſt, of Chriſt Jeſus in the grave, upon the laſt Sabbath, till the day of his reſurrection was prefigurate. Wherein a threefold type (moſt worthy of obſervation) is to be marked. Firſt, by the virginall conception, of the bleſſed ſeed: the virginall conception of the bleſſed body of our Saviour, in the new hewen Tombe, out of a Rocke, wherein no man was ever laid, was prefigurate. Secondly by the Virgins going three quarters of a yeare with the bleſſed Child: the three daies reſt, of the bleſſed body of Chriſt Jeſus in the grave was prefigurate.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, as the renting the Vaile of the Temple did prefigurate, the renting of of the ſacred Virgins wombe, in the bringing forth of her firſt borne, the word made fleſh; without the help of woman or man, (which was the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall birth day of the Son of God. (So by the Virgins bringing forth of her firſt borne (the word made fleſh) the myſticall bringing forth of the firſt borne
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:49359:91"/> evangelicall Word, by the myſticall Virgin Sabbath (without the help of any created power) was prefigurate. Which was the myſtical birth day of the Evangelicall word. Whoſe myſticall birth day, being the juſt ſeventh day, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the laſt formall propheticall Jewes Sabbath (as man naturally deſcended of Adam is obliged to the Law of God) his myſtical birth day, is the true ſeventh day, of the Evangelicall Law. By the power of the word of his ſeventh daies Evangelicall reſt, commanding the Evangelicall worſhip of the ſeventh day of his Law by man, and in the ſeventh day, the Evangelicall obedience of man, to his whole Evangelicall Law, implied in the ſeventh day. To whoſe faithfull obedience, the eternall bleſſing of his Evangelicall birth daies reſt is due by the Law of God. The ſecond type and figure, whereby the myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Virgin Sabbath was prefigurate: was the Sabbaticall yeare of Jubile. For firſt as in the yeare of Jubile, all bound men, all ſold and pawned Land, the earth and the labouring Cattell were ſet at liberty; So by the bloody reſt of Chriſt Jeſus bleſſed body in the grave (for the ſpace of the whole laſt Sabbath) all men condemned and bound by the curſe of the Law for the ſin of Adam, to eternall death and darknes, and the creatures created for man, where freed from the eternall curſe of the Law, and ſet at liberty. Secondly as the yeare of Jubile (by the immediate influence of God) without all labour, help, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry of man the earth (of its owne accord) did produce the fruit thereof, for the comfort of man, and for the creatures created for man, So by the myſticall Sabbath, (without all the help, aide, or aſiſtance of any man natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally deſcended of Adam) did bring forth the Evangelicall word (enabled by the immediate act of his owne infinit power (upon the joyfull day of his reſurrection: Who is the life, light, and foode of man, and by whom only man and all the creatures created for man, doe live, move, and have the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation of their redeemed being. The bleſſed day of whoſe myſticall Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall birth, being the juſt ſeventh day, from the laſt formall Jewes prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Sabbath (as man naturally deſcended of Adam, is obliged to the Law of God) the bleſſed day therefore of the Lords reſurrection, is the true ſeventh day of the Evangelicall Law of righteouſnes of faith, whereby the Son of righteouſnes, in his bleſſed day began to ſhine one high, by inlightning the ceremoniall darkneſſe of the propheticall Sabbath (propheſying his death) through all the Nations of the world, by the light of his bleſſed day, leading all men (by the hands of faith) to lay hold on the Evangelicall word, the Lord of the life, light, and reſt of man, and of the creatures created for man, to be inbelized by the thankfull praiſes and <hi>Jubiles</hi> of all the Nations of the world. The myſticall Evangelicall birth day therefore, of the Evangelicall word (the Lords day) is the true joyfull day of all the years of this life, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:49359:92"/> by the myſticall yeere of Jubile; which by the truth of the Lords Evangelicall reſt, from the fulfilling of the promiſe of the bleſſed ſeed (ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from his bloody reſt) is the true Evangelical word of the ſeventh day of the Law of righteouſnes of faith, next to be declared.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. VII.</head>
                  <head type="sub">The declaration of the Evangelicall word.</head>
                  <p>THe Evangelicall word is taken in a twofold ſenſe, firſt, the Evangelicall word is taken eſſentially for the ſecond perſon of the ſacred Trinity (God equal with the Father and Holy Spirit) in which ſenſe the Evangelical word is incommunicable to man or Angel. Secondly, the Evangelical word is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for the word of the Lords day (the 7th day of the Evangelical Law of faith) as it is the Image of God in his Son Chriſt Ieſus. For as the Lords daies Evangelicall reſt, is the Image of the Lords eternall life and reſt: So the light of the Lords day is the Image of his inacceſſable light, and in this ſenſe the Evangelicall word, is communicable to man, and it is the life and light of man, and hath a twofold acception; firſt the Evangelicall word, is taken for the word of the Lords day, as it is the Evangelicall word of the ſeventh day of the Law of righteouſnes of faith. Secondly the Evangelicall word is taken, for the word of promiſe and new covenant, whereby both God and man are mutually obliged. For though the word of the ſeventh day of the Law, and the word of promiſe and covenant, be really one, yet they are of a formall difference. Firſt therefore of the Evangelicall word of the Lords day, as it is the word of the ſeventh day of the Evangelicall Law of righteouſnes of faith.</p>
                  <p>The Evangelicall word of the Lords day, is the ſame reall word which was from the beginning. And therefore it is ſaid by Iohn 1.4.5, that in it (that is) in that word was life, and that that life, was, the light of man, which doth in this manner appeare. Firſt in the ſtate of perfection, by the word of the Law written in Adams heart ſpiritually enlightned, Adam did live, move, and had the perfection of his naturall and ſpirituall being, and felicity. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Adam was the Image of righteouſnes and holines. And the word of the firſt ſeventh day, of the Law of righteouſnes (implying the command of the whole Law) was objected to Adams externall ſenſes, obliging Adam to the command of the Law of righteouſnes. To the merit of whoſe perfect obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, the bleſſing of the firſt ſeventh daies eternall reſt, was due by the Law of righteouſnes. Wherby, Adam had the continuation of his created eſtate of perfection and felicity, while Adam did ſtand in the perfection of
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:49359:92"/> his obedience: And was to have continued, eternally upon earth, to Adam by covenant; if Adam had continued in the perfection of his obedience. The word of God therefore to Adam, before the fall (as he was the head of all men naturall to deſcend of his loines) was the word of the firſt ſeventh day of the Law of righteouſnes, implying the command of the whole Law. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, Adam (in whome as in the head, all were created) having tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed the command of God, of the Law of righteouſnes, the tranſgreſſion was infinit, for the tranſgreſſion of the Law (as it is the Law of righteouſnes) is an immediate contempt againſt the infinit Majeſty of God, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the ſinne infinit. And the ſecond Perſon of the Trinity in whom is only mercy (being then not revealed to Adam) the ſinne was without any hope of revealed mercy: wherby Adam and all men created in Adam (as head) naturally to deſcend of Adam, were (in the juſtice of God by covenant) condemned to the eternall curſe of the Law of righteouſnes, by the curſe of eternall death and darknes. Adam therefore, and all men naturally to deſcend of Adam (as head) out of the infinit love and mercy of God to man in his Son Chriſt Ieſus (according to his decree from all eternity) being redeemed from the curſe of the Law by the curſed death of his only Son (which was to be ſuſtained in his prefixed time) the word of the Law then written in the heart of man, was the redeemed Image of God in his Son Chriſt Ieſus, by the power of which redeemed word, Adam after the fall did live, move, and had his redeemed grace of naturall and morall being; but ſhut up in ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all darknes till he was regenerate. And the word of the ſeventh day of the Law, was then objected to Adams externall ſenſes, as it was the propheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call word of the ſeventh day of the Law of righteouſnes of faith in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of the bleſſed ſeed: then by the name of the Sabbath of the Lord, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſying the reſt of the Lord (to wit) the bleſſed ſeed upon the Sabbath from the redemption of man from the curſe of the Law for the ſinne of Adam, whereby Adam (and all men naturally to deſcend of Adam) till the promiſe of the bleſſed ſeed was fulfilled, were obliged to beleeve the promiſed reſt of the bleſſed ſeed. To whoſe faith, the bleſſing of the Lords promiſed reſt (by the propheticall Sabbath) was due by the Law. The word of God therefore to the Fathers (till the promiſe was fulfilled) was the propheticall word of the ſeventh day of the Law of righteouſnes of faith, in the promiſe of the bleſſed ſeed, by the light of the ſabbaticall ſeventh day, leading the faith of man, to the bleſſing of the Lords promiſed reſt of the bleſſed ſeed. By which faith, all the Fathers were ſaved, before the promiſe was fulfilled, in the Lords prefixed time according to his eternall decree. Thirdly, the promiſe of the bleſſed ſeed, being fulfilled, (by the Lords daies Evangelicall reſt) as
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:49359:93"/> by the redeemed word of the Law written in the heart, the naturall man, doth live move and hath his redeemed grace of naturall and morall being, ſhut up in ſpirituall darknes till he be regenerate. So the Evangelicall word of the Lords day (as it is the ſeventh day of the Evangelicall Law of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes of faith) is objected to the externall ſenſes of man, as it is the word of the truth of the Lords Evangelicall reſt, from the fulfilling of his promiſe of the bleſſed ſeed, obliging the faith of all the Nations of the World, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve the truth of the Lords fulfilled promiſe, to whoſe faith, the bleſſing of the Lords merit of eternall life and reſt, (by the fulfilling of his promiſe) is due morally by the Law, whereby the naturall mans redeemed grace of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and morall being, is continued while he is in this life, and being regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat, hath his eternall life, light, and reſt in the life to come.</p>
                  <p>The judicious reader therefore may plainly obſerve that the Evangelicall word of the Lords day (the ſeventh day of the Evangelicall Law of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes of faith) is the ſame reall word, which was from the beginning, in the true knowledge wherof is the life, light, &amp; eternal reſt of man: for as by the literall light, of the Lords day, the naturall man is literally led to the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall bleſſing of the Lords merit, by the Lords daies Evangelicall reſt: So by the Lords ſpirituall light (in Gods prefixed time) the naturall man apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding himſelfe dead in actuall ſpirituall ſinne (as ſinne is a fearfull contempt againſt the infinit Majeſty of God.) The naturall man in this ſpirituall feare (being led by this ſpirituall light, to the Lords infinit merit) doth (by the hands of his ſpirituall faith) lay ſuch ſpirituall hold on the Lords infinit me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, as all the created powers of God, and all the temptations of the Divell, and the World, are not able to part the naturall man (being regenerate) from the grace of his ſpirituall hold. And this is that faith, which the Lord ſaith, is able to command, the greateſt Mountaine of temptation, and to caſt it ſelfe in the Sea, if it ſtand in the way, to ſeperate the regenerate man, from his ſpirituall hold of eternall life. Though his ſpirituall faith be ſo litle, as a graine of muſtard ſeed. For the threatned Mountaine of naturall death it ſelfe, is not able, to ſeperate the regenerate man, from this ſpirituall hold totally and finally.

                  <p>THe firſt is, the difference of the word of the Law written in the heart of man, and the word of the ſeventh day of the Law (implying the command of the whole Law) externally objected to the externall ſenſes of man.</p>

                     </gap>e ſecond is the formall difference of the word of the ſeventh day of the Law from the beginning. Firſt in the ſtate of perfection, the word of the Law written in Adams heart, was the power of the Image of righteouſnes and holines, enabling Adam, to merit eternall life and reſt upon earth. And the word of the firſt ſeventh day of the Law of righteouſnes, was objected to Adams externall ſenſes, obliging the perfection of Adams obedience, to the command of the Law of God: to whoſe merit (by his actions of holines) the bleſſing of the firſt ſeventh daies eternall reſt, was due by the Law to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams merit. Secondly man being redeemed from the curſe of the Law, the word of the Law, written in the heart, is the redeemed word, and Image of God in his Son Chriſt Ieſus, firſt in the promiſe of the bleſſed ſeed, enabling Adam, from faith to faith to beleeve the promiſe of the bleſſed ſeed. And the word of the ſeventh day of the Law of righteouſnes of faith, by the name of the Sabbath of the Lord, was objected to Adams externall ſenſes, prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſying the reſt, of the bleſſed ſeed, upon the Sabbath, from the redemption of man from the curſe of the Law, obliging and commanding Adam, to beleeve the promiſed reſt, of the bleſſed ſeed; to whoſe faith, the bleſſing of the Lords eternall reſt, was due by the Law, to Adams faith: in beleeving the the promiſed reſt of the bleſſed ſeed. Thirdly after the Lords reſurrection, the promiſe of the bleſſed ſeed (being fulfilled) the redeemed word of the Law written in the heart of man, is the Image of God, in his Son Chriſt Ieſus in the truth of his fulfilled promiſe of the bleſſed ſeed enabling all men by mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ſaith, to beleeve the Lords fulfilled promiſe of the bleſſed ſeed. And the Lords day (the ſeventh day of the Evangelicall Law of faith, bleſſed and ſanctified by the truth of the merit of the Lords Evangelicall reſt) is now ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to the externall ſenſes, obliging all the Nations of the World, to believe the truth of the Lords merit, by his reſt from the fulfilling o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> the promiſe of the bleſſed ſeed. To whoſe faith, the bleſſing of the Lords eternall reſt, is due by the Evangelicall Law of faith.</p>
                  <p>As for the formall difference, of the word of every ſeverall ſeventh daies reſt of the Law, from the beginning, it doth conſiſt in theſe two pointes.
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:49359:94"/> Firſt the formall difference of the ſeventh day of the Law (implying the command of the whole Law) doth ariſe from the formall manner, of Gods revealing of himſelfe, by the word of his ſeverall ſeventh daies reſt, by the formallity of which ſeverall reſt, the formall worſhip of the ſeventh day is commanded. The ſecond difference is, that by the leaſt tranſgreſſion of the Law of righteouſnes (in the ſtate of perfection) the ſinne was, without all hope of any revealed mercy, or time of repentance. But the tranſgreſſion of the Law of righteouſnes of faith, is withall hope of mercy, and time of repentance, while there is day in this life. Of this declaration of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelicall word, as it is the redeemed word of truth written in the heart of man: And as it is the Evangelicall word of the Lords day, the ſeventh day of the Evangelicall Law of faith, (implying the perfection of the redepmtion of man from the curſe of the Law for the ſinne of Adam,) I infer theſe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent neceſſary demonſtrative concluſions.</p>

                  <p>IT is by the redeemed word of the Law (as the Law is ſpirituall, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly written in the ſoule of man, neceſſarily implying the power of intelec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall life and light) that the ſoule doth live, and hath its intellectuall moving, and being, which is the firſt act of the ſoule of man, as he is intelectuall, and a true humane ſpirit in potency, to his ſecond intelectuall act. And it is by the word of the Law literally written in the heart of man (neceſſarily implying the power of naturall life and light) that man (as he is man) doth live, move, and hath his redeemed being, which is the firſt act of man, (as he is man and a rationall creature) in potency to his ſecond naturall and morall act, by the ſpecies of the externall ſenſitive object, and this is the reaſon that Iohn ſaith Iohn 1.4. in it was life, and that life was the light of man.</p>

                     <hi>Concluſion.</hi> 6. The literall light of the Lords day (the ſeventh day of the Lords Evangelicall reſt) doth farre ſurmount the light of all the ſeverall ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth dayes reſt, of the eternall word, from the foundation of the world, for by the literall light, of the Lords day, the naturall man is fundamentally and literally led to all the former ſeventh daies reſt, of the eternall word, from the beginning: all proceding from the love of God to man.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Concluſion.</hi> 7. The literall light of the word of the Lords day, doth emply, the literall light of all the Scripture of God; and conſequently, the whole excercite act, of the ſacred decree of predeſtination, ſo farre as is revealed to man in this life.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Concluſion.</hi> 8. By the Lords daies Evangelicall reſt, from the fulfilling of his promiſe of the bleſſed ſeed, (ariſing from his bloody reſt) the Lord did manifeſt himſelfe truth, and in that truth, love, and mercy to man.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Concluſion.</hi> 9. As our Saviour (by his birth, life, death, and by his reſt in the grave) did manifeſt himſelfe true man and (by his wonders, and mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles) did manifeſt himſelfe the Son of God begot of the ſeed of the woman,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:49359:95"/> by the immediate unction of the holy Spirit: So by the infinit power, of his Evangelicall reſt (in his triumphant victory, over the power of Satan, ſinne, eternall death, and darkneſſe of Hell over the power of the curſe of the Law, and over the power of the grave his laſt enemy) the Lord did manifeſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, Lord God and man, in the three coeſſentiall diſtinct Perſons, of the glorious Trinity, the maner whereof, is clearly ſet downe in the Chapter fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Concluſion.</hi> 10. As by the Lords Evangelicall reſt, from the fulfilling of the promiſe of the bleſſed ſeed (ariſing from his bloody reſt) was by his infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit power. So his merit by his reſt from the redemption of man (from the curſe of the Law, and from his fulfilling of the Law for man by his bloody reſt) was likewiſe infinit. By the power of whoſe infinit merit, by the Lords daies Evangelicall reſt (as it is the word of the eternall life and reſt of man) the formall worſhip of the Lords day is commanded in ſpirit and truth. And therefore the Lord told the Samaritan woman. <hi>The houre commeth and now is, when the true worſhippers ſhall worſhip the Father</hi> (and conſequently the Son and holy Spirit) <hi>in Spirit and truth. For God is a Spirit, and they that worſhip him, muſt worſhip him in Spirit and truth.</hi> By which words, the formall Evangelicall worſhip of the Lords day is both ſet downe and commanded by the Lord of the Lords day: For firſt, the Lord told the Samaritan woman, commanding her to beleeve that the houre ſhould come, which is the houre of the Lords day, which was then to come. Secondly, the Lord commanded the Samari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan woman to beleeve that God is a Spirit, and muſt be worſhipped in Spirit and truth, (that is) in the Spirit of faith, in the truth of his Evangelicall reſt f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>om the fulfilling of his promiſe of the bleſſed ſeed: Which is the formall E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelicall commanded worſhip of the Lords day, which muſt be ſanctified by man after that formall manner, in the Spirit of faith in (the truth of the Lords merit by his Evangelicall reſt as he) hath manifeſted himſelfe to man by the day of his reſurrection, (to wit) Lord God and man, in the three co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſentiall diſtinct Perſons of the glorious Trinity.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, whereas the Lord, told the Samaritan woman that God muſt be worſhipped in Spirit and truth, and that the Father requireth ſuch worſhip. The formall Evangelicall worſhip of the Lords day, is immediatly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by the Lord of the Lords day, for Gods will and requiring of man, by his word, is the Lords immediate command to man. Fourthly, whereas the Lord ſaid to the Samaritan woman (the houre is) in theſe words, the Lords laſt will &amp; teſtament (to be executed after the teſtators death) is fully implied, for in the commanded worſhip of the Lords day, the whole Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall morall Law of God (which is the whole Evangelicall word) is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:49359:95"/> implied. Fiftly, while as the Lord ſaith to the Samaritan woman, the houre cometh, when ye ſhall neither worſhip the Father, in this Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine or at Jeruſalem: By theſe words, the formall ceremoniall worſhip of the propheticall Sabbath (implying the whole propheticall ceremoniall Law) is actually determined by the actuall immediate commanded Evangelicall worſhip of the Lords day, to the great comfort of both Jewes and Gentiles, in t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <hi>Concluſion.</hi> 11. All propheticall ceremoniall worſhip, is barred from the truth of the Lords commanded worſhip, for by ſuch ceremoniall worſhip, the truth of the Lords fulfilling of his promiſe of the bleſſed ſeed, is belied and neceſſarily denied, by the will worſhip of man.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Concluſion.</hi> 12. All ceremoniall pretended worſhip of God; by any maner of carved or painted Image, objectively repreſenting to the eyes of man, the Son of God (as he is man) is contradictory to the truth of the Lords com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded worſhip by his Evangelicall reſt, from the fulfilling of his promiſe of the bleſſed ſeed, as he is God and man: For firſt, by this ceremoniall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended worſhip, God is immediatly worſhipped as he is man: Secondly by the intervening of the ſenſitive object, between the Lord and his worſhip, the Lords worſhip is neceſſarily interrupted, and conſequently the worſhip, a falſe faithles, idolatrous worſhip, neceſſarily denying the truth of the Lords commanded worſhip.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Concluſion.</hi> 13. All mediate pretended worſhip of God, by invocation of Angels or Saints departed this life, is repugnant to the Lords infinit merit, by the truth of his Evangelicall reſt. For firſt, by the immediate object of ſuch worſhip, intervening between the worſhipper and the Lord, (as by his infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit merit, he is eternall life, &amp; reſt) the infinitnes of his merit is confined. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, prayer being a moſt eſſentiall part of Gods immediate worſhip, by ſuch invocation of the object, to which the prayer is directed, the worſhip of God is neceſſarily interrupted, while as man (by the Lords owne immediate command) is commanded to call upon the Lord himſelfe, immediatly, in the day of trouble, and neither upon Saint or Angel: And conſequently ſuch me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate pretended worſhip of God, equall idolatry with the former.</p>

                  <p>This twofold reſurrection of the Word, doth comprehend the twelve Articles of Chriſtian faith, all depending one upon another, like as many links of a chain, linked one into another, all ariſing from the literall light of the Lords day, (by his reſt and reſurrection from the fulfilling of his promiſe of the bl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The Lords reſurrection from the grave, doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend theſe ten fundamentall points of faith.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, by the literal light of the ſound of the evangelicall Word of the Lords day (really one with the literall light of the redeemed Word of the Law, written in the heart of man, whereby man doth live, move, and hath his redeemed ſtate of being;) the naturall mans underſtanding is morally produced in act, (by the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate ſenſe of hearing) to underſtand, that the Lords reſurrection from the grave, was the laſt period of his reſt from the redemption of man, and all things loſt by man, from the curſe of the Law for the firſt ſin of Adam.

                  <p>Secondly, as by our Savi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>urs bloody death, and reſt in the grave, (neceſſarily preſuppoſing his birth and life) our Saviour did manifeſt himſelf true man: ſo by our Saviours gracious words, glorious wonders and miracles, while he was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally upon earth (as our Saviour was man, the Son of God before all time;) ſo he did manifeſt himſelf man, the Son of God, in time, begot of the ſeed of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, by the overſhadowing act of the Almighty.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, as our Saviour, (as he is the eternall Son of God) by his ſuſtaining of the eternall curſe of the Law, did merit the ſalvation of Adam, (and of all men na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally to deſcend of Adam) from the firſt death (which was the curſe of the Law for the ſin of Adam:) ſo our Saviour by his bloody reſt in the grave, for the full ſpace of the ſeventh day of the laſt Sabbath (whereby the Law was fulfilled, as he was obliged to the Law for man,) as our Saviour is the eternall Son of God, he
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:49359:98"/> did merit, the eternall life and reſt of the firſt ſeventh day loſt by Adam, due by the Law, to his eternall merit, which is the bleſſing of the Lords day, offered to the faith of all the nations of the world, by the new covenant, whereby all the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full are ſaved from the ſecond death, which is the curſe of the Law of faith.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, (by the literall light of the ſound of the word of the Lords day) the naturall mans underſtanding, is morally produced in act (by the mediat ſenſe of hearing) to underſtand that the Lords reſurrection from the grave, was by his reſt from the power of eternall death and darkneſſe of hell, from the eternall curſe of the Law, the cauſe of eternall death; from ſin (which he made himſelf for man) the cauſe of the curſe of the Law, from the power of Satan, the cauſe of ſin, and from the power of the grave, his laſt enemy; whereby the Lord, by the immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate act of his own immediate infinite power, did gloriouſly and triumphantly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt himſelf truth to man, by the fulfilling of his promiſe of the bleſſed ſeed, and in that truth, love and mercy to man, and by that truth, love and mercy, Lord God and man, in the eſſentiall union of the divine and humane nature, Lord, God and man, equall with the Father, and holy Spirit: Lord, God and man, equall with the Father, by the work of the redemption of man eternally loſt, by the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall curſe of the Law, and by the redemption of the creatures which were curſed for the ſin of man, which are equall to the works of the creation: and the Lord did manifeſt himſelf, Lord, God and man, equall with the holy Spirit, as by the continuall influence of his bleſſing, the creatures which he hath redeemed, are conſerved in their redeemed eſtate, which is the proper bleſſing of the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, proceeding from the Father and the Son.</p>
                  <p>The name (Lord) therefore, is the name of the eſſentiall union of the divine and humane nature, neceſſarily implying the three coeſſentiall diſtinct perſons of the glorious Trinity, and conſequently implying the name Jeſus, and Chriſt: For, as by the Lord, God and man, the loſt creatures are r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d as by the continuall influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of his bleſſing, the creatures are conſerved; he is Chriſt the anointed with the oile of gladneſſe, the holy Spirit, and ſanctifier; and conſequently, as the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed word written in the heart of man, (by the power of which redeemed word, the naturall man doth live, move, and hath his redeemed ſtate and grace of naturall and morall being) is the Image of God in his Son Chriſt Jeſus, ſo the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed word in the heart of man, is the Image of the Lords truth, love, and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, whereby the naturall man is morally enabled (by the act of his underſtanding and will) to produce the works of truth, love, and mercy.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, the Lords reſt and reſurrection from the fulfilling of his promiſe of the bleſſed ſeed, being by his infinite immediate power, his merit by his reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:49359:98"/> and reſt is infinite; and his love and mercy to man by his reſt, is infinite.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, as by the infinit power of the Lords merit (by his reſurrection and reſt) the day of the Lords reſurrection, is bleſſed and ſanctified for his worſhip by man (to whoſe faithfull worſhip, the infinite bleſſing of the Lords merit of eternall life and reſt, is due by the Evangelicall law of faith:) ſo by the infinite power of his merit, the Evangelicall worſhip of the Lords day, is immediatly commanded, and in that immediate worſhip, (as the Lords day is the Evangelicall ſeventh day of the Evangelicall law of faith, implying the command of the whole law) the whole Evangelicall law is commanded, obliging all the nations of the world to believe the truth of the Lords fulfilled promiſe, to whoſe faith the bleſſing of the Lords Evangelicall eternall reſt is due by the law, whereby the faithfull man is ſaved from the ſecond death, which is the curſe of the law of faith, and doth enjoy eternall life.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, the naturall man, being commanded to believe that by faith in the Lords merit, he is ſaved from the ſecond death; and Evangelicall faith being the act of the redeemed heart of man, and the originall of all his naturall and morall actions, (to which all men are inabled by the power of the redeemed Word of truth, love, and mercy, written in the heart of man:) faith therefore being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded immediatly by the literall command of the law, (though neceſſarily im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying the ſpirituall command) in the command of faith, the works of truth love and mercy, are neceſſarily commanded, which are the works of faith, without which, faith is but a dead faith, and man but a dead man; dead in actuall ſin, though he doth live, all the days of this life. To the knowledge of which actuall ſin as the naturall man is led by the literall light of the law, implyed in the command of the Lords day: So by the knowledge of death, by actuall ſin, the naturall man is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to morall repentance; And by repentance to amendment of life, by the works of truth, love, and mercy, to which he is morally enabled by the power of the redeemed Word of truth, love and mercy in his heart, which are the works of faith, whereby the Lords merit is morally apprehended.</p>
                  <p>Eighthly, the new covenant made between God and man, being eſtabliſhed, upon the immediat command of the Lords day, (the ſeventh day of the Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call law of faith) as the Lord doth oblige himſelf to man, to conferre the actuall bleſſing of the Lords dayes eternall reſt to the faithfull believer; ſo the Lord by his covenant doth oblige the finall contemner of his infinit merit, to the actuall merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe eternall curſe of his Law. The Lords merit of mercy therefore being infinit, there is mercy for man all the day of this life: For, the new covenant is made to all men whatſoever, and at what time ſoever: For, <hi>Mar.</hi> 13.13. whoſoever ſhall endure to the end ſhall be ſaved. This end to the naturall man, is his finall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance, in his morall obedience, till the Lords prefixed time of his ſpirituall
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:49359:99"/> calling, by the ſpirituall grace of faith, whereby the naturall man, being regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, is ſaved, who hath nothing to neceſſitate his morall diſobedience: And though he doth ſtumble and fall; yet (by the power of the redeemed word writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in his heart) the naturall man hath freedome to repent morally, without ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitating of his impenitency; for morall repentance muſt neceſſarily precede morall faith. As the naturall man therefore is no wayes to diſpaire of the Lords infinite mercy, while there is day in this life, (for the diſpairer of the Lords infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite mercy, doth belie the Lords mercy, and doth detract from the infinitenſſe of the Lords merit;) ſo the naturall man is no wayes, (by his preſumptuous conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance in ſin and wickedneſſe) to contemn the Lords long patience, leading him ſo graciouſly to repentance, leſt the Lord (in his juſtice) give him over to a repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate minde, that he cannot repent, though he hath all the dayes of this life to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent by covenant.</p>
                  <p>Ninthly, the law of God being eternall, (eternally obliging man, as he is man) and the reward of the law, due by the law, to the merit of man, being according to the law eternall; there muſt be therefore reſurrection from the dead, that man, as he is man, intellectuall and ſenſitive, may receive the eternall reward of the law in the full extent, to wit, eternall life and reſt to the faithfull believer, in the merit of man, Jeſus Chriſt the eternall Son of God; and the curſe of the law by eternall death, to the merit of man the proud finall contemner of the Lords infinit merit, offered ſo freely to him in this life. The reward therefore of the law, in the full extent (as the reward is eternall) cannot be received by man till the laſt day.</p>
                  <p>Tenthly, (the Lord being the head of all men redeemed from the curſe of the law for the ſin of Adam) as the Lord hath his univerſall redeemed Church in all the nations of the world, (who by the power of the redeemed word of truth, love, and mercy, written in their heart) are all morally united by one faith, in one bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and by that faith, morally united to their head, the gracious Redeemer of all men: So the Lord being the myſticall head of his myſticall members, the Lord hath his myſticall univerſall Church, all united in one myſticall body, by ſpirituall faith; and by ſpirituall faith, all ſpiritually and indiviſibly united to their myſticall head. Theſe are the firſt ten fundamentall points of faith ariſing from the literall light of the Evangelicall ſound of the word of the Lords day, by the Lords reſt and reſurrection from the grave, leading the naturall mans underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by faith, to apprehend the Lords merit, to ſave him from the curſe of the law of faith. Next therefore of the fundamentall points of faith ariſing from the Lords reſurrection from the earth by his aſcention to the heavens; to which his reſurrection from his grave doth extend) where the Lord ſitteth at the right hand of the infinite power of the Father, whence two fundamentall points of faith doth ariſe.</p>
                  <pb n="189" facs="tcp:49359:99"/>
                  <p>Firſt, the Lord (according to his promiſe, that the ſeed of the woman ſhall break the head of the old Serpent, and the head of his curſed ſeed) hath obliged himſelf by the new covenant, that by his ſecond coming from the heavens (glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly united to his myſticall members) ſhall revenge the blood of man upon Satan and his curſed ſeed. Firſt, the blood of man, firſt betrayed by Satan, to fall under the curſe of the law. Secondly, the blood of man, Jeſus Chriſt, the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Son of God, by his redemption of man from the eternall curſe of the law. Thirdly, the blood of the Lords myſtical members, perſecute by Satan and his cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſeed, for their valorous defending of his ſacred truth in this life: For, the Lord as head, united to his myſticall members, is the myſticall man, who muſt break the old Serpents head, and the head of his curſed ſeed, in the grat day, afterwards more fully to be declared This breaking of the head of the old Serpent, and of the head of his curſed ſeed, is by the Lords judging, condemning, and by the actuall inflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the eternall curſe and reward of the law (in the full extent) to the gre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The ſecond fundamentall point of faith, ariſing from the Lords reſurrection from the earth by his aſcention to the heavens, is, that the Lord hath graciouſly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged himſelf by the covenant, to ſend the Comforter, <hi>John</hi> 16.7. (the Spirit of truth) by whoſe ſpirituall light, (enlightening the ſpirituall darkneſſe of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall man) the Lords myſticall members are begot, and by the ſpirituall power of whoſe ſpirituall life, by that ſpirituall light, the regenerate are enabled, with the gift of patience to overcome all the afflictions and temptations of Satan and of his curſed ſeed in this life, which is the Lords earneſt of their incorruptible crown of glory in the life to come for their valor, in their defence of his truth in this life. In theſe twelve fundamentall points of faith, as by the literall light of the ſound of the word of the Lords day, (by his reſt and reſurrection from the grave) the naturall mans underſtaning is morally enlightened: So by the power of the redeemed Word of truth, written in the heart, the naturall man is morally enabled to believe theſe twelve fundamentall points of faith: And therefore by the new covenant, all men are obliged and commanded to believe theſe twe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

By this literall light therefore of the ſound of the truth of the Evangelicall word of the Lords day, the judicious Reader is enabled with all boldneſſe to condemn all tenents and aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of faith, repugnant to the truth of this light; for falſe adulterous tenents and aſſertions. And with the like boldneſſe, to condemn all pretended worſhip of God, repugnant to the truth of the Lords Evangelicall commanded worſhip in ſpirit and truth, for a falſe adulterous worſhip of God, ariſing from the falſe light of error.</p>

                  <p>This falſe light from whence this adulterous worſhip of God doth ariſe, is the ceremoniall light of ſome ſenſitive viſible object, whereby the underſtanding is produced in act, by the mediate ſenſe of ſeeing, which for the moſt part, is the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive objective carved or painted image of the eternall Son of God, as he is man, which is a moſt faithleſſe falſe adulterous and idolatrous worſhip. It is faithleſſe, becauſe faith is by hearing of the Word (the Image of God in his Son Chriſt Jeſus) and not by the ſeeing of the Image of our Saviour in his humility, as he is man. It is falſe worſhip, becauſe it doth belie the truth of the Lords glorious reſurrection: it is an adulterous worſhip, becauſe it is repugnant to the truth of the light of the Lords commanded Evangelicall worſhip, in ſpirit and in truth: It is an adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous worſhip, becauſe the ſenſitive viſible object doth interveen between the Lord and his worſhip; and in this ſenſe, a lier is called an Idolater, becauſe the falſhood which the lier doth maintain, doth interveen between the lier and the light of the Word of truth, love, and mercy in his heart, which is the Image of God, obliging the heart of the lier, to declare and witneſſe the truth, which is called the light and law of conſcience; and ſo is the covetous man, under which name, the lier, hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite, coozener, cheater, extortioner, briber, whoremaſter, drunkard, murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, and in a word, the foul malitious cruell affection of man: for, by all ſuch foul deſire of the covetous man, the light of the word of truth, love and mercy in the heart (redeemed by our Saviours ſacred blood) is belied, darkned, and obſcured, and the foul deſire worſhipped as an Idol, contrary to the light of the command of the word of the ſeventh day of the law really one with the literall light of the law written in the heart of man.

Secondly, the ſpecies of the ſenſitive Image, doth interveen between thy mind and the Lords worſhip, whom thou art commanded to worſhip immediatly; and conſequently, thy put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in minde an Idolatrous mentall worſhip; for preventing of which Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous worſhip, the faithfull Miniſter, by the ſound of the word is commanded to inſtruct the people committed to his charge at his peril; for by the new covenant,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:49359:100"/> the Apoſtles are immediately commanded, to teach and to preach the truth of the Lords Evangelicall worſhip, to all the Nations of the world, as the Lord hath revealed himſelfe, by the Evangelicall reſt of the Lords day. And in the Apoſtles, the Apoſtolicall ſucceſſors (the Miniſters of the word) are commanded, to the like teaching and preaching of the truth of the Lords Evangelicall commanded worſhip, to the people committed to their charge. The new Covenant therefore, being commanded, as well upon the mercileſſe curſe of the Law of faith, as upon the bleſſing of the Lords Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall reſt; It doth ſtand the Miniſters of the Sacred word in hand, to look to the faithfull diſcharge of ſo ſtrict an impoſed task.</p>
                  <p>Now, though in the commanded Evangelicall Sacraments, (implying the Lords whole laſt Will and Teſtament, which is the Evangelicall word) the word be objectively preſented to the ſenſe of ſeeing, touching, taſting and ſmelling; as by the light of the ſound of the word, it is objected to the ſenſe of hearing, that man as he is man, may receive the word ſacramentally, that is, by faith in the word repreſented by the externall elements: Yet this ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentall object, doth not repreſent the object of faith, (to wit, the Word Jeſus Chriſt the Son of God) to come, and to ſuffer for the ſins of man; but doth repreſent him by his curſed death of the Croſſe, by his bloudy reſt in the grave, and by his Reſurrection from the grave, to be received ſacramental<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by faith in his merit, by his curſed death of the Croſſe, by his bloudy reſt in the grave, and by his Reſurrection and reſt, from the fulfilling of his promiſe of the bleſſed ſeed; which both the Sacraments doe moſt lively ſignifie: for the better conceiving whereof, it is to be underſtood, that the Sacraments were not delivered in the primitive Church, but to ſuch as were come to actuall, naturall, and morall underſtanding and action.</p>

                     </gap>ith: And therefore I ſay, That faith is not by reading of the word, as the written word, is the object of the ſence of ſeeing: but as the written word doth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſe the word ſpoken, (for it is the word ſpoken that is read) in which caſe morall faith may be ſaid to be by reading. For, many times God (by his objective concurſive grace) doth concurre with the naturall mans reading of the word, and with the reading of the ſpirituall Writers upon the word, whereby the naturall mans underſtanding is enlightened, and his will mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved morally to beleeve the word, and his heart inclined, to give morall obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the literall command of the word: But while God doth not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>curſive objective grace (which is in his free pleaſure) the naturall man readeth but a dead letter; for the life of the word is in the ſound of the word to the hearing: while as by the ſpirituall Miniſters word, the heart of man (where the redeemed word of the Law is written) is rouzed and moved by the ſound of the word, threatning of Gods judgements for ſin, whereby man is raiſed from ſin, and moved to arme himſelfe againſt Satan and his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments. And this is the reaſon that the Miniſters of God are called Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peters; for, as at the ſound of the Trumpet the whole Army is rouſed, to Arme themſelves againſt the enemy: ſo at the ſound of the word by the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall Miniſter, man is rouſed and ſtirred up, to reſiſt the temptation of Satan, and of his inſtruments.</p>

                  <p>FIrſt, the whole Evangel is only the ſound of the word of the Lords day, from the Lords promiſe of the bleſſed ſeed, to his conception of the ſeed of the woman: from his conception to his birth: from his birth to his death, from his death to his reſt in the grave, whereby he did manifeſt himſelfe, firſt, that he was the promiſed bleſſed ſeed, the Son of God, the light and life of man, by his gracious word, by his glorious wonders and miracles. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that he was love and mercy to man (Love) by his gracious curing of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſenſitive diſeaſes of man (incurable by man as he is only man.) Mercy by his pardoning of ſinne as he is the Son of God. Thirdly, Chriſt Jeſus the Son of God (begotten of the ſeed of the woman) did manifeſt himſelfe by his death, that he is the Saviour of all men for their ſinne in Adam: Fourthly, by his fulfilling of the Law (in his reſt in the grave for the whole ſpace of the ſeventh day of the laſt Sabbath) the eternall life and reſt of the firſt ſeventh day (loſt by Adam) was manifeſted to be redeemed by our Saviour. All per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by Jeſus Chriſt, the Son of God, man begotten of the ſeed of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. But his reſurrection from the grave (by his reſt from the fulfilling of the Law implying his bloody reſt in his grave from the redemption of man) was by his infinit power, as he is Lord Jeſus Chriſt the Son of God begotten of the ſeed of the woman (by the immediate unction of the holy Spirit) God equall with the Father and holy Spirit, By whoſe reſt the Lords day (the day of the Lords reſurrection) was bleſſed and ſanctified for the Lords thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full worſhip by man, implying the light of the word of the whole Evangel: Though the Lords day, was firſt called (by the Evangeliſts) the day of the Lords reſurrection, to convince the falſe report of the Jewes who had ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orned the Keepers of the ſacred grave, to affirme, that the Diſciples had ſtolen away the Lords bleſſed Body, from the grave. As the Lords day was
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:49359:102"/> called by the Apoſtles, the firſt day of the weeke: leaſt by naming of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſeventh day then the great propheticall Sabbath, in the firſt plantation of the Evangel, the ſtubborne Jewes ſhould have utterly rejected the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing of the Evangel. All which is but the light of the ſound of the word of the Lords day.</p>
                  <p>But of all the ſounds of the word of the Lords day in the Evangel: Iohn Baptiſts ſound (that Elias) did paſſe all: for his ſound was, as if the Lord then had ſuffered, and had riſen from the dead: For firſt by Iohns pointing at the Lambe of God, that taketh away the ſinne of the World, our Saviours death was ſignified. Secondly, by Iohns baptizing of our Saviour, (in Chriſts ſubmerſion and riſing out of the water) his reſt in the grave and reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, was lively expreſſed. Thirdly, by Iohns affirming, that he did ſee the Spirit of God (in forme of a Dove) to deſcend from Heaven upon our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our; the calling of the Jewes and Gentiles (by the new Covenant) was moſt lively expreſſed, for by the Doves outſtreched wings, the Lords armes of mercy (by his Evangelicall bloody reſt) were ſpread out from Heaven, to embrace all the Nations of the World. Secondly, the whole tractate of the acts (from end to end) is nothing elſe, but the light of the ſound of the word of the Lords day. For by the ſounding of the word of the Lords, reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by the Apoſtles, what a world of wonders and miracles, were wrought, and how many thouſands (by the light of the ſound of the word) came (by the hands of faith) to lay hold on the Lords daies Evangelicall reſt? Thirdly, the new Covenant, is immediatly, eſtabliſhed upon the Evangelicall word of the Lords day by inſeperable union. Fourthly, the Apoſtle doth affirme, that the ſound of the word (to wit) of the Lords day, went to the ends of the earth. Fiftly, Iohn doth call the day of the Lords reſurrection the Lords day. Sixtly, the Apoſtle to the Hebrews doth ſet downe the Lords day, the Evangelicall Word of the ſeventh day of the Law of righteouſneſſe of faith, moſt plainly ſaying, firſt, that after a long time (which was the time of the promiſed reſt of the propheticall Sabbaticall ſeventh day) there was another certaine ſeventh day, appointed in David (that is) in Davids ſeed. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the Lord of life, to wit the Son of David, did enter this day into his reſt, from his reſting from the fulfilling of his promiſe of the bleſſed ſeed, which is his Evangelicall reſt, neceſſarily implying his bloody promiſed Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baticall reſt from the worke of the redemtion: As he did firſt reſt, from the workes of the creation: Thirdly, the Apoſtle proveth that this day appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in David, was for the people to enter into this ſeventh daies reſt: For (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>Hebrews</hi> 4.8. if Joſhua could have given the people of Iſrael reſt (to wit) by the promiſed reſt of the propheticall Sabbaticall ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth

Seventhly, <hi>David</hi> doth prophetically affirme, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 118 24. Firſt, that this is the day which the Lord hath made, exhorting all men to rejoyce in this bleſſed day; which day <hi>David</hi> did ſee, with his ſpirituall eyes of faith: for the Lord did fulfill this propheſie of <hi>David</hi> indeed, for the Lord made this day with his precious bloud. Secondly, <hi>David</hi> doth prophetically af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 118.22. that it was the glorious light of this ſeventh dayes reſt, (which <hi>David</hi> calls the corner ſtone) which the Judaicall builders did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe, and now is made the head of the corner, mounted above the heaven of heavens, (the Tabernacle not made with hands) wherein the Lord of life, (Head of his myſticall members) is entered, to make continuall interceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (as their Advocate,) at the Throne and Alter of righteouſneſſe, by the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of his fulfilling of the Law of righteouſneſſe; whereby all the actuall ſins of his myſticall members (united to their myſticall head, by his indiviſible love) are covered, and freed from the curſe of the Evangelicall Law of faith, by the new Covenant. As by his curſed death of the altar of the Croſſe, they are freed from the curſe of the Law, for their ſinne in Adam by the firſt Covenant. Eightly, the Lord himſelfe doth affirme, <hi>John</hi> 8.56. that Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham did ſee this his joyfull day, (to wit) with his ſpirituall eyes of faith, in the eight day of the Sacrament of circumciſion, wherein there doth lye no ſmall myſterie; for, the child was to be circumciſed upon the eight day, though the eight day did fall upon the propheticall Sabbath day: upon which day no worke was to be done, under the paine of death, much leſſe the ſhedding of mans bloud.</p>
                  <p>The ſhedding of mans bloud therefore upon the Sabbath, was onely law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, by the command of the Sacramentall circumciſion: for, both the propheticall Sacraments (implying the whole propheticall ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall Law) were commanded in the Church of God, before the Law was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:49359:103"/> to Moſes, to the end that the Jews might underſtand, that the Law to the fathers, before Moſes and after Moſes (till Chriſts reſurrection) was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally one, and the ſame Law of God, and one and the ſame formall obliege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Law. The point of the myſterie lyeth in this; That the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of circumciſion, (which was the eighth day) was preferred to the command of the Sabbath, which was the ſeventh day of the Law, implying the command of the whole Law. Now, the Sacrament of circumciſion, was but the ſhadow of the Sacrament of the Lords day, which was the eight day from the laſt propheticall Sabbath, reckoning the propheticall Sabbath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſively, for the firſt day in the accompt of the eight dayes: though by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning the accompt, from the laſt formall Jews propheticall Sabbath, (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſively) the Lords day, as man naturally deſcended of Adam is oblieged to the Law, is the juſt ſeventh day from the laſt formall Jews propheticall Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, as hath beene declared. What an admirable faith was this of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham to ſee this day ſo farre off, which the Lord affirmeth that Abraham did ſee, and that Abraham did rejoyce in the ſight of this bleſſed day? Ninth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the Lord of life, (the Lord of the Evangelicall law of the righteouſneſſe of faith) the true eternall reſt of the Evangelicall ſeventh day of the Law, doth call this bleſſed day, his owne day, <hi>John</hi> 85.6. His owne day, by all true title, and right of righteouſneſſe it ſelfe, his owne; which in ſpite of the power of darkeneſſe muſt ſhine till the eternall day. Tenthly, this is the moſt joyfull day of dayes, for by the Evangelicall ſound of the Lords dayes Evangelicall reſt, the Jews and Gentiles, were actually called to one Church, and were made one fold, to the joyous and thankfull jubiliſing of all the Nations of the world. Eleventhly, by the Evangelicall ſound of the Lords daies Evangelicall reſt, (ariſing from his bloudy reſt) all the propheticall Sabbaths, all the jubilees of Sabbaths, and all the propheſies, propheſying from the foundation of the world, of the comming and ſuffering of the Lord of life, (the promiſed bleſſed ſeed) are actually determined. Twelfthly, by his bloudy Sabbaticall reſt, neceſſarily implyed in his Evangelicall ſeventh dayes reſt of the Lords day: All the altars and ſacrifices, (the foundation of the partition wall of the ceremoniall Law) and all the figures, types, rites, and propheticall ceremonies, from the foundation of the world built there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, (by which partition the Gentiles were barred, from the judiciall ſervice of God) all are raſed from the very foundation, never to be reiterate in the Church of God. Laſt of all, Mary Magdalen did not know the Lord of life, <hi>John.</hi> 20.16 17: (the eternall reſt of his bleſſed day) though Mary did ſee the Lord with her bodily eyes, till ſhe heard the ſound of the word, of the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall ſeventh dayes eternall reſt, calling Mary. At the hearing of the
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:49359:103"/> ſound of whoſe Evangelicall word, while Mary knowing the Lord, would have embraced him, in her armes; the Lord ſaid, Mary touch me not; to wit, but by thine arms of faith.</p>
                  <p>The Lord, after his reſurrection, did firſt honour Mary, to be the joyfull trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peter to ſound the news of the word of his myſticall Evangelicall birth-day, to the Apoſtles themſelves, as the Lord of life, the Son of God, as he is man, did honour Mary, the bleſſed Virgin, to be incloſed in her wombe, and to be the firſt proclaimer of the joyfull day of his naturall birth. Though woman therefore (ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by the falſe trechery of Satan) was the inſtrument of the fall of man; yet woman, firſt and laſt, was the moſt happy news-bringer, of the moſt joyfull ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings that ever came to man or Angel. Let a man therefore honour woman, whom God the Lord hath ſo highly honoured: For, firſt, woman was the happy inſtrument of the ſalvation of man, and of the confirmed grace of the Angels. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, woman was the happy inſtrument that man is crowned with the incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible crown of glory eternally in all heavenly happineſſe; whereas, though man had ſtood in the ſtate of perfection, man muſt have enjoyed his perfection and felicity but eternally upon earth.</p>
                  <p>And ſo much for the declaration of the Evangelicall word, as the word is the ſeventh day of the Evangelicall law of faith, implying the command of the whole law, which is the Lords day, the bleſſed day of dayes. We are next, according to our method, to declare the Evangelicall word, as it is the word of the new cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and promiſe of God. But a queſtion doth ariſe of the Lords day, firſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily to be anſwered.</p>

                  <p>I anſwer, becauſe it is by the light of the ſeventh day of the Evangelicall law of faith, (by the truth of the Lords Evangelicall reſt and reſurrection from the fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of his promiſe of the bleſſed ſeed) that Jeſus is known to be the Saviour of man, the eternall Son of God, Lord, God and man, equall to the Father and holy Spirit (as hath been formerly declared,) by the infinite ſanctified power of whoſe bleſſed merit, the Lords day is bleſſed and ſanctified, and the Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call worſhip of the Lords day, immediatly commanded. Though Jeſus there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, be the name of the Son of God, as he is man, begot of the ſeed of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and the Saviour of man, by his curſed death and bloody reſt in the grave,

The Lords day therefore is the day of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, immediatly, and not immediatly the day of Jeſus: And conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the bowing of the knee at the name of Jeſus, is the bowing of the knee at the name of the Lord Jeſus; by which bowing of the knee, the Evangelicall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded worſhip of the Lords day is implied; as may plainly appear by the Apoſtles words, ſaying, that God hath given him a name above all names, that at the name of Jeſus, every knee ſhall bow, and that every tongue ſhall confeſſe, that Jeſus Chriſt is the Lord: For, as the religious bowing of the knee is from the believing heart, (implying the Spirit of the mind) that Jeſus, the Saviour of man, is the Lord, (wher<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The externall bowing of the knee therefore, at the name of Jeſus (without ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding or implying (Lord) proceeding from the believing of the heart) is but a faithleſſe and irreligious worſhip of God by man. In theſe words of the Apoſtle, concering the bowing of the knee, (which is a Propheſie, and now fulfilled by the Lords dayes Evangelicall reſt and reſurrection) three ſpeciall things are to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved:</p>

<pb n="199" facs="tcp:49359:104"/> the ſecond perſon of the Trinity. And therefore we ſee, that in the Apoſtles ſalutations by their Epiſtles) they do pray for peace and grace from God the Father and from our Lord Jeſus Chriſt: For as the Lord is man (the Son of God equall with the Father and holy Spirit before all time) ſo he is man, the Son of God in time of the ſeed of the woman in the eſſentiall union of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine nature of the Father, Son and holy Spirit, with the humane nature: Lord God and man. And conſequently, the three coeſſentiall diſtinct Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the Trinity Lord God and man.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond thing to be obſerved in the words, is, that by the things in Heaven, the Saints departed this life; and the bleſſed Angels, are to be un<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>derſtood: for as the Saints in Heaven doe (with all humility) acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge their glory and heavenly felicity, to the only merit of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt: So doe the Angels (with all humility) acknowledge the conſerved grace of their created perfection to the merit of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, to whom his merit doth extend, who are conſerved as miniſtring ſpirits, for man: Firſt, for man, Chriſt Jeſus, while he was perſonally upon earth, that his foo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The third thing to be obſerved, is, that by things upon earth, man and the ſenſitive and inſenſitive creatures created for man, are to be underſtood; and by things under (or within the earth) the waters, mineralls, and other things created for the uſe of man, which as they were all curſed for man, ſo they are all redeemed from the curſe with man; in whoſe behalfe man is to bend the knees of his heart, with all thankeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and to teſtifie his thankfulneſſe, by his thank-worſhip of the Lords day, as the Lord hath revealed himſelfe by the Lords dayes Evangelicall reſt, Lord Jeſus Chriſt God and man in the three coeſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall diſtinct perſons of the glorious Trinity. And ſo much for the declaration or the Evangelicall Word, as it is the word of the Lords day the ſeventh day of the Evangelicall Law. Next (according to our methode) the Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Word is to be declared, as it is the word of promiſe and new Covenant made by God with man.</p>

                  <head type="sub">The Evangelicall Covenant made by God with man, in his Son Chriſt Jeſus called the new Covenant.</head>
                  <p>The Evangelicall Word of the Lords day (the ſeventh day of the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall Law of righteouſnes of faith) &amp; the Evangelicall Word of promiſe
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:49359:105"/> and new Covenant, are really one, but of a formall difference. Firſt, of the reall unity of both, and next of the formall difference. The reall unity of both, doth conſiſt in this, that the word of promiſe and new Covenant (which is the Lords merit of eternall life by his reſurrection and reſt from the fulfilling of his promiſe of the bleſſed ſeed) is the bleſſing of the Lords day: For by the Lords infinit merit (by the Lords daies Evangelicall reſt) the Lords day, is bleſſed, ſanctified, and commanded, for the ſeventh day of the Evangelicall Law, implying the command of the whole Evangelicall Law of faith. And conſequently, the word of promiſe and new Covenant, and the word of the Lords day really one, for the one is neceſſarily implied in the other, as may appeare by the ſeverall names of the new Covenant. Firſt, the new Covenant is called the Covenant of grace, becauſe the Lords merit of eternall life (by the Lords dayes Evangelicall reſt, from the fulfilling of his promiſe of the bleſſed ſeed, which is the bleſſing of the Lords day) is freely offered to all beleevers, by the new Covenant, without all reſpect to the merit of any man naturally deſcended of Adam, whereby all beleevers are ſaved from the ſecond death, which is the curſe of the Law of faith. And conſequently the word of promiſe, and the word of the Lords day are really one. Secondly, the new Covenant is called the Covenant of truth, becauſe the Lord, by his Evangelicall reſurrection and reſt, from the faithfull fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of his promiſe of the bleſſed ſeed, (upon his bleſſed day did manifeſt himſelfe truth to man) by the truth of whoſe infinite merit (by his Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall reſt) the Lords day is bleſſed, ſanctified, and commanded. Which bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of eternall life, is word of promiſe, and new Covenant, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the word of promiſe, and the word of the Lords day really one. Thirdly, the new Covenant is called the Covenant of mercy; becauſe, as the Lord (by his Evangelicall reſt) did manifeſt himſelfe truth to man; ſo in that truth, the Lord (by his infinite merit) did manifeſt himſelfe, love and mercy to man: for, as by his curſed death of the Croſſe, our Saviour did me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit the ſalvation of all men, from the curſe of the Law, for the ſin of Adam: So by his bloudy reſt in the grave, by his fulfilling of the law in the ſeventh day of the laſt Sabbath, the eternall life and reſt (loſt by Adam from the firſt ſeventh day of the law) was due to the Lords merit, whereby all beleevers are ſaved from the ſecond death, extending his twofold love and mercy to all men by the new Covenant: whoſe mercy (according to the truth of his infinite merit) being likewiſe infinite: The Lords gracious armes of mercy, are outſtretched to the penitent ſinner, for all the daies of this life, by the new Covenant. And this is the reaſon, that wretched men do ſo inſult, upon the Lords infinite mercy, by their continuance in ſin and wickedneſſe, becauſe
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:49359:105"/> they ſee the daily love and mercy of God extended to all men in this life, whoſe Sun doth ſhine, and his rain doth fall, both upon the juſt and the unjuſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.45. And this is likewiſe the reaſon, that many (though moſt unjuſtly) do grudge the temporall bleſſings of God to the wicked, who, though they do enjoy the tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall bleſſings of the Lords merit, by his Evangelicall reſt; yet they are far from the ſpirituall bleſſing of the Lords merit, whereby man is only ſaved. But the Lord hath thus graciouſly obliged himſelf by the new covenant; firſt, that wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched man ſhould not diſpair of the Lords mercy, while he hath all the dayes of this life to repent him of his actuall ſins: Secondly, that the wicked may be excuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe: For, though God willeth that all men ſhould be ſaved, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.4. by teſtifying of their thankfulneſſe for their redemption, by the works of truth, love, and mercy, to which they are morally enabled (by the redeemed word of the law, written in their heart) yet while the wicked man (without any created power, to neceſſitate his morall diſobedience) doth (by his obſtinate continuance in ſin and wickedneſſe) make himſelf the curſed ſeed of Satan. The Lord doth juſtly give him over to a reprobate minde, and doth moſt juſtly will his condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; where (by the way) the difference between the firſt and ſecond cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, is to be obſerved for the leaſt tranſgreſſion of the law by the firſt covenant, was without all revealed hope of mercy, or time of repentance; but the ſecond covenant (both Prophetically and Evangelically) is with all hope of mercy by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance for all the days of this life: Fourthly, the new covenant, is called the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of faith; becauſe the Lords merit of eternall life, by his Evangelicall reſt, (which is the bleſſing of the Lords day) is the immediate object of faith; and therefore the Evangelicall law, is called the law of righteouſneſſe of faith, though the works of faith, (which are the works of truth, love, and mercy) are equally commanded in the command of faith, which is the neceſſary, ſole immediate effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent cauſe of the works of faith; and therefore neceſſarily commanded in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of faith: while the Apoſtle therefore doth affirm, that man is juſtified by faith, without the works of the law, we muſt underſtand, that the works meaned by the Apoſtle, are the ceremoniall works of the Propheticall law, and not the Evangelicall works of faith; to which works, the Apoſtle doth exhort both the Jews and Gentiles; and therefore the Apoſtle James ſaith, ſhew me thy faith by thy works. Now, the Lords merit of eternall life (which is the bleſſing of the Lords day) being really one; the word of promiſe and new covenant, and the word of the ſeventh day of the Evangelicall law are really one, and ſo much for the reall unity of both: next of the formall difference.</p>
                  <p>The formall difference of both, doth conſiſt in this, that by the new cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, God and man are mutually obliged in the Evangelicall word of the Lords day: For, as God by his new covenant doth formally oblige man to believe the
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:49359:106"/> truth of his fulfilled promiſe of the bleſſed ſeed, by his Evangelicall reſt: So the Lord doth mutually oblige himſelf by the truth of his merit (by his Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call reſt) to ſave the believer from the curſe of the ſecond death; obliging like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the unbeliever, and finall contemner of his free gracious offer, to the merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe curſe of the law of faith.</p>
                  <p>But, by the Evangelicall word of the Lords day, (the ſeventh day of the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall law) the Lord doth formally command man to teſtifie his beliefe, to the word of eternall life, as the Lords Word is his law to man. The chief precept of whoſe law, is the commanded worſhip of the Lords day; in which commanded worſhip, the whole Evangelicall law of righteouſneſſe of faith, as formally and neceſſarily commanded, commanding the faith of man in the originall; which is the love of the heart, where the redeemed word of the law is written, really one with the Evangelicall word of the ſeventh day of the law (the Lords day) by the power of which redeemed word in the heart (which is the Image of God in his Son Chriſt Jeſus, truth, love, and mercy it ſelf) all men are morally ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled by the works of truth, love and mercy, to give morall obedience to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Evangelicall law, which are the works of faith; the chief work whereof is the truth of the commanded worſhip of the Lords day, whereby the Lord by his Evangelicall reſt, hath manifeſted himſelf truth, love, and mercy to man. The judicious Reader, therefore, may plainly perceive, that though there be a formall difference between the word of the ſeventh day of the Evangelicall law, and of the word of promiſe and the new covenant: yet they are really one and the one neceſſarily implyed in the other: For, (as hath been formerly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared) God cannot morally command man to his new covenant, but by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate command of the word of the ſeventh day of the law, implying the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the whole Evangelicall law, which is the Evangelicall word of the Lords day: For, there is neither life, light, or the power of command, in any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of the Evangelicall law of righteouſneſſe of faith, but by the only immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate commanded worſhip of the Lords day, in that commanded worſhip, imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the command of the whole law. And therefore the bleſſing of the Lords merit (by the Lords dayes Evangelicall reſt) is only and immediatly due (by the law) to the faithfull worſhip of the Lords day, for the fulfilling of the whole law, which is fulfilled by faith in the Lords infinite merit, by whoſe infinite ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified merit, (by his Evangelicall reſurrection and reſt from the fulfilling of his promiſe) the Lords day is the word of eternall life and the immediate object of Chriſtian faith; without the command therefore, of the Lord day, (as it is his law to man,) there is neither life, or light for man, or any law or new covenant, or any object for the faith of man dead in actuall ſin, as all men, (freed from the curſe of the law for the ſin of Adam) are before they be regenerate, by their
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:49359:106"/> tranſgreſſion of the law of faith. And therfore as our Saviour by his bloody reſt in the grave by his fulfilling of the command of the ſeventh day, did fulfill the whole law (as our Saviour was oblieged to the law for man) to whoſe merit the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life and reſt loſt by Adam is due by the law? ſo the Lord Ieſus Chriſt (eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life and reſt) by his reſurrection and reſt from the fulfilling of his promiſe of the bleſſed ſeed upon the day of his reſurrection, did obliege all men again to his new Covenant, by the immediate command of the Lords dayes commanded wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, (bleſſed and ſanctified by his merit), to believe in his fulfilled promiſe of the bleſſed ſeed; to whoſe faith, the bleſſing of his merit of eternall life is due by the law which is commanded in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded worſhip of the Lords day, as may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by the word of promiſe &amp; new covenant: <hi>Go and teach &amp; preach the Evangel to all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the holy Spirit,</hi> Mar. 16.15, 16. <hi>he that ſhal believe, ſhall be ſaved, but he that wil not believe, ſhall be condemned.</hi> The ſenſe of the word of the covenant is this: Go and preach the Evangel, that is, go and preach &amp; proclaim the glad tidings of my reſurrection and reſt, this day from the fulfilling of my promiſe of the bleſſed ſeed (which is the ſumme of the whole Evangel, implied in the Lords day, by the Lords Evangelicall reſt;) go therefore, preach the Evangel to all nations, baptizing them, in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the holy Spirit, as my my reſurrection and reſt this day from the power of ſin, Satan, hell, eternall death, the curſe of the law, and the power of the grave, I have manifeſted my ſelf (by mine own infinit immediate power) Truth to man by the fulfilling of my promiſe; and in that truth, love, and mercy to man, and in that truth, love, and mercy, God and man, in the three coeſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall diſtinct perſons of the Trinity; whoſoever ſhall believe in me, (to wit, eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life, and reſt by the power of my infinit merit by my Evangelicall reſt) ſhall be ſaved from the curſe of the ſecond death, for the tranſgreſſion of the law of faith, as by my bloody reſt in the grave, (from the curſed death of the croſſe) all men are ſaved from the curſe of the law for their tranſgreſſion of the law in Adam, which is the firſt death; he that will not believe in me, ſhall be condemned, to wit, to the mercileſſe curſe of the Evangelicall law of faith, which is mercileſſe. This ſalvation and condemnation of man, (being the twofold reward of the Evangelicall law, due by the law, according to the obedience or finall diſobedience of man): The Lord commands man to his new covenant by the immediate word and command of the Evangelical law, by which command the reward is only due. The chief precept of whoſe Evangelicall law, being the precept of the Lords com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded worſhip (implying the command of the whole Evangelicall obedience and Religion of man). The Lords day therefore, (by the Lords immediate word) is commanded, and in the Lords day (as it is the ſeventh day of the Evangelicall law) the obedience of man, to the whole Evangelicall law is neceſſarily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded.
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:49359:107"/> Thus, according to the truth of the ſacred word, having ſet down the true ſenſe of the new covenant; I next ſet down the formall obligement of man to the Evangelicall law of God by the new covenant.</p>
                  <p>As the Lords reſurrection and reſt, from his fulfilling of his promiſe of the bleſſed ſeed (upon the Lords day) doth extend to the ſafety of all men from the curſe of eternall death for the firſt ſinne in Adam: And to the ſafety of all belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, dead in actuall ſinne, for their owne naturall tranſgreſſion, of the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall law of righteouſneſſe of faith: So the merit of the Lords reſurrection, doth likewiſe extend, to the confirmation of the bleſſed Angels, in the grace of their created perfection, who are ſent as miniſtring ſpirits, for the ſaving of the elect, from being finally overcome, by the temptation of ſatan and his cruell inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. The Lords reſurrection and reſt therefore (upon the Lords day) being the moſt joyfull newes that ever came to Man or Angell, his ſeventh dayes reſt is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally Evangelicall; and conſequently the commanded worſhip of the Lords day, formally Evangelicall; which is therefore commanded in ſpirit and truth, that is in the ſpirit of faith, in the truth of the Lords merit, to the joy and comfort of all the Nations of the world. For both Iew and Gentile (by the immediate com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Lords dayes commanded Evangelicall worſhip) are freed from the ſore yoke of the ſabbaticall ſeventh dayes Propheticall ceremoniall worſhip, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying the whole ceremoniall law.</p>
                  <p>According to the formall Evangelicall worſhip therefore of the Lords day (the ſeventh day of the Evangelicall law) the whole Evangelicall law of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of faith, is formally and Evangelically both obliged and commanded, by the immediate word of the Lord of the Lords day by his new Covenant, obliging and commanding, the faithfull obedience of all the Nations of the world (firſt and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately) to the commanded Evangelicall worſhip of the Lords day, and in that commanded worſhip commanding the faithfull obedience of man to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the whole Evangelicall law of faith, that by beleeving in the Lords me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit (by the Lords dayes evangelicall reſt) they may be ſaved from the curſe of the ſecond death: to which command all men are morally enabled by the redeemed word of the law written in their heart, really one with the command of the Lords day.</p>

                  <p>OF the declaration of the Lords day a twofold Queſtion may be moved: The firſt is, whether (in any morall right by the command of the law) the laſt

The ſecond queſtion is, Whether (in any morall right by the command of the law) the laſt Sabbath might not have been worſhipped for the Lords day, the firſt Evangelicall ſeventh day of the law of faith?</p>
                  <p>Firſt, I anſwer to the firſt Queſtion.</p>
                  <p>Leſt there be a miſtake in this Diſcourſe, I firſt ſtate the Queſtion. The queſtion here, is not in the matter of fact, whether the Jews did celebrate, or did not celebrate, the ceremoniall worſhip of the laſt Sabbath, for the Jews propheticall Sabbath. But the Queſtion is, whether (in any morall right by the command of the Law) the Jews might have worſhipped that day, by the Ceremoniall worſhip of their propheticall Sabbath. And now I anſwer; And do affirme, that it is impoſſible (by any right of the command of the law of God) that the Jews might have celebrated the laſt Sabbath, for their propheticall Sabbath; for ſuch commanded worſhip had inferred a twofold neceſſary contradiction in the command of the law. For firſt, by ſuch ceremoniall worſhip of the laſt Sabbath, Chriſts death ſhould have been prefigurate to be hereafter, while as his ſacred body lay in the grave.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, though the formall propheticall Jews Sabbath day, was not actually determined, till it was immediately determined, by the day of Chriſts reſurrection from the grave: yet all the propheſies, of all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheticall Sabbaths, all the jubilees of Sabbaths, and all the propheſies, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſying of Chriſt, from the foundation of the world, were all actually de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, by his reſt in the grave, for the whole ſpace of the laſt Sabbath. So that if there ſhould have beene any ſuch command of the law; the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies ſhould have beene fulfilled, and not fulfilled as by the ceremoniall worſhip of the laſt Sabbath Chriſt ſhould have beene dead, and not dead, which is a twofold contradiction. Neither in all reaſon, durſt the High Prieſt that day, offer to celebrate the ceremoniall worſhip of the golden Altar, (which he was to diſcharge, after the ſervice of the brazen Alter) and that for this twofold feare. Firſt, the great rent (from the top to the bottome) of the Vale of the Temple, was juſt betweene the golden Alter, and the Table of Shew-bread, where a great deale of ſtones and rubbiſh muſt fall, whereby the table of Shew-bread, and the golden Alter were parted; myſtically ſignifying to the High Prieſt, that the bread of life was ſeperate, and departed from the ceremoniall worſhip of the golden Altar. Now, the golden Altar ſtanding ſo neere to the great ruinous wall, the Prieſt in his comming up to offer ſweet Incenſe at the golden Altar, might have beene afraid to be brained with the ſtones falling from the great rent of the Vale.</p>
                  <pb n="206" facs="tcp:49359:108"/>
                  <p>The next feare was farre greater: for, the high Prieſt in his comming up to offer Incenſe at the golden Alter, (the rent of the wall being ſo great) muſt have ſeene the Arke of the Covenant, the golden Crown and the Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubims covering the Mercy-ſeat, to which the glorious lights of the golden Candleſticks were directly oppoſite; Now it was death for the Prieſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to looke on the Arke of the Lord, with any materiall light: Inſomuch, that (out of all queſtion) by the reflex of the light of the golden Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks, from the golden Crowne, Cherubims, and Mercy-ſeat, and from the gliſtring gold of the golden Alter: All the Prieſts were that day confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. Though the High Prieſt, or any man that day, without any feare, might have entered the higheſt place, and have touched, and looked on the Arke; but it was more then was then knowne to the high Prieſt. Againſt this it may be objected: Luke the Evangeliſt ſaith, <hi>Luke</hi> 23 56. That the women, according to the command of the Law, reſted from going to the ſacred grave that day, which command of the Law, was the command of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheticall Sabbath day, I anſwer. Luke, the faithfull Hiſtoriographer of the ſacred Hiſtory, doth faithfully relate the act of the religious women, with the preciſe circumſtance of the time of the act, what the women (then full of ſorrow for the Lord of life) were conſtrained to doe, out of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the command of the Sabbath, which was that day in force, for ought that the women did know: But Luke, doth not relate what the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men might have done that day: Neither had it been ſitting for the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt ſo to have done; for the formall command of the Sabbath day (as it was the formall propheticall Jews Sabbath day) was not actually determined, till it was determined by the next day, the day of Chriſts reſurrection from the grave, to wit, the Lords day though the propheſies of the Sabbath were then actually determined. And ſo much for anſwer to the firſt Queſtion.</p>
                  <p>To the ſecond Queſtion, I anſwer. That it had beene as impoſſible (in any morall right by the command of the Law) that the laſt Sabbath (for the whole ſpace whereof the bleſſed body of our Saviour reſted in the ſacred grave) could have beene worſhipped for the Lords day. For firſt, the mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, ſorrowfull, and lamentable light of the ſound of the word, of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day of the laſt Sabbath, had been repugnant to the joyful Evangelicall ſound, &amp; light of the word of the Lords day. Secondly, the Evangelicall wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the Lords day, to have beene celebrate, upon the laſt Sabbath; had im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed a manifeſt contradiction, in the command of the law; for, ſo the law ſhould have commanded the day of the Lords reſurrection to be worſhipped in ſpirit and truth; while as contrary to all truth, the ſenſitive body of our Saviour did lye dead in the grave that day. Thirdly, by the commanded wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:49359:108"/> of that Sabbath, to be celebrate by the Evangelicall worſhip of the Lords day had been contradictory to the ſacred written Word of God, by his eternall decree; for the laſt enemy to be conquered by the Lord of life, was the grave. Fourthly, the commanded Evangelicall worſhip of that day, had been contradictory to Chriſts own propheſie, which was, that he ſhould riſe again the third day, while by his Evangelicall worſhip, he muſt have riſen the ſecond day. Fifthly, by ſuch commanded Evangelicall worſhip of the laſt Sabbath; the Apoſtles muſt have been falſe witneſſes, in preaching and proclaiming, that the Lord was riſen from the grave, while his ſacred body did reſt in the grave. Sixthly, ſuch Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall worſhip of the laſt Sabbath had overthrown the chief Article of Chriſtian faith: For all Chriſtians are obliged to believe, that the Lord of life roſe the third day from the grave, and not the ſecond day; and ſo much for anſwer to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond queſtion againſt this declaration of the Lords day, three obejections are to be anſwered.</p>

                  <p>FIrſt, it may be objected; that by the eſtabliſhing of the Lords day, for the Evangelicall morall ſeventh day of the law of faith, there is one ſeventh day of the law, (implying the whole law) loſt in the account. Now, heaven and earth muſt periſh before a jot or a tittle of the law ſhall periſh, <hi>Luke</hi> 86.17. For the law of God is eternall. I anſwer, By this account, there is neither any jot or tittle of the ſeventh day of the law of God loſt; neither by this account is there my prejudice at all to the decreed ſix dayes work, allowed by the law to man: For the ſeventh day of the laſt Sabbath, implying the whole law (as Chriſt Jeſus was obliged thereby, as he is man) was fulfilled by himſelf. Now, by the fulfilling of the law, the law is eſtabliſhed, and not loſt; if man (by his finall obſtinate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the law) ſhould eſcape the curſe of the law, at Chriſts ſecond coming, then the law we loſt indeed: Or, if the Lord had not fulfilled the command of the ſeventh day of the laſt Sabbath, (as the Lord did oblige himſelf by the prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall covenant) the ſeventh day of the law (implying the command of the whole law) had been likewiſe utterly loſt, as man Chriſt Jeſus, the Son of God, was obliged to the command of the law. This objection therefore, is eaſily an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, by the former declaration: For, God and man being mutually obliged to the propheticall covenant, by the ſeventh day of the law, (then by the name of the Sabbath of the Lord) the obligement of man to the propheticall covenant, was formally twofold: Firſt, man (to wit) Adam (and all men naturally to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend of Adam) were formally obliged to the command of the ſeventh day, as it was then the propheticall Sabbath, obliging the faith of man to believe the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:49359:109"/> reſt of the bleſſed ſeed, propheſied by the prophetical Sabbath, untill the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed reſt was fulfilled by the bleſſed ſeed: Secondly, man, the Son of God (Chriſt Ieſus the bleſſed ſeed) was formally obliged by the propheticall covenant, to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill his promiſed reſt, by his obedience to the command of the ſeventh day of the laſt Sabbath, as it was propheſied by the propheticall Sabbath: who having fulfilled the command of the laſt Sabbath (by his obedience) even to the death of the Croſſe by his redemption of man, from the curſe of the law for the ſinne of Adam: And by his reſt in the grave (after his death) upon the laſt Sabbath, haveing fulfilled the whole law in the command of the ſeventh day: The eternall life and reſt, of the firſt ſeventh day loſt by Adam, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed likwiſe for man, and due by the law to our Saviours merit. Now the eternall life and reſt of man, being in our Saviour: The Lord by his reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the grave, did manifeſt himſelfe, truth to man (by the fulfilling of his promiſed reſt) and in that truth, Lord God, Jeſus Chriſt the eternall Son of God, God equall with the Father and holy Spirit, the eternall life and reſt of man, The day of whoſe reſurrection, being the juſt ſeventh day of the law, as man naturally deſcended of Adam, is obliged to the law of God; the Lord by the power of his merit by his Evangelicall reſt, from the fulfilling of the law for man (implying his bloody reſt from the redemption of man from the curſe of the law for the ſinne of Adam) doth command the day of his reſurrection (the Lords day) to be worſhipped by man, for the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day of his Evangelicall law. And therefore to conclude this anſwer, The ſeventh day of the law (by the laſt Sabbath) being fulfilled by our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours obedience even to the death of the Croſſe: and the ſeventh day of the law (as man naturally deſcended of Adam is oblieged to the law) being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, in the command of the Lords day, there is not any ſeventh day, or any jot or tittle of the law loſt, as man is oblieged to the law of God. Where the judicious Reader may obſerve, that as the gracious promiſe of the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſeed, went forth from the eternall Word, (eternall life and reſt) So by the fulfilling of his promiſe, the eternall life and reſt of man, is returned to the Word. And this is the reaſon, that God is called <hi>Alpha and Omega,</hi> the firſt and the laſt, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.13. all in all. Even as wee ſee the great Ocean, from whence all the wells, ſprings, brooks, rivers, and all the waters falling from the clouds doe proceed; So all do returne to the Ocean, from whence they came: and ſo much for anſwer to the firſt objection.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The ſecond objection is this.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Neither Chriſt Jeſus or his Apoſtles, have ſet downe the command of the Lords day, in the written word of God. The Lord therefore, hath left the power to command the Lords day, to the Apoſtolicke Succeſſours, Miniſters
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:49359:109"/> of the Word and Sacraments to command (for that bleſſed day) what day of the weeke they ſhall thinke fitting. Of all the objections, that ever was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected by man, this is one of the moſt fearfull: which doth raſe from the foundation, all what hath bin faithfully declared in this tractate, and the very foundation of truth it ſelfe: where there is two maine fundamentall points of faith overthrowne: the firſt is in the antecedent: the next is in the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent. I anſwer firſt to the antecedent. By this aſſertion, that the Lord of life (the Lord of the Law of righteouſneſſe of faith) or his Apoſtles hath not commanded, the Lords day (the Evangelicall ſeventh day of the Law of righteouſneſſe of faith) the Lord of life, is charged with the foule aſpertion of untruth: For if the ſeventh day of the Evangelicall Law of faith, imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the command of the whole Law, be not immediatly commanded, by the Lord himſelfe, by his immediate word, there is never a precept, of the whole Evangelicall morall Law commanded. And therefore to vindicate the truth of God from this horrible aſpertion, I anſwer, after this threefold manner.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, if we touch this tenet, with the touchſtone of the twofold Theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicall Canon ſet downe in the tenth Chapter of this third booke; we ſhall find this tenet, to vaniſh with the objecters breath; firſt, therefore to touch the tenet with the firſt Canon. Firſt, the foule adulterous light of the ſound, of the falſe word of this aſſertion, is repugnant, to the light, of the ſound of the word of the Lords day, and to the truth of the Lords Evangelicall reſt: For by the immediate power of his infinit merit by his Evangelicall ſeventh daies reſt, the ſeventh is bleſſed and ſanctified, and the worſhip of the ſeventh day commanded, and in the ſeventh day, the whole morall Evangelicall Law of faith. To the faithfull obedience of man, to which command the tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall bleſſing, of the Lords daies Evangelicall reſt, is due to man, whereby man hath the continuation of his redeemed light, life, and reſt in this life, and eternall reſt in the life to come: contrary to the adulterous light, of the ſound of the words of this tenet, whereby the Lords day, is affirmed to be by the immediate command of man, by meanes whereof, we muſt hold our life, light, moveing, and being, in this life, and eternall reſt in the life to come, immediately from the command of man. Next to touch the tenet with the ſecond Theologicall Canon ſet downe in the forenamed Chapter. By the ſound of the words, of this falſe aſſertion, the command of man doth inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veene, and come betweene the faith of the beleever and the Lords merit, by his Evangelicall ſeventh daies reſt; which being the rocke and reſt, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the viſible Church of God is built, by this aſſertion, the Church of God it ſelfe, and the Lords commanded worſhip is raſed from the very foundation. For my ſecond anſwer to this aſſertion, to wit, that neither Chriſt or his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:49359:110"/> hath commanded the Lords day in the written word of God. I anſwer with the Apoſtle Iohn. 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 2, 7. There is no new command, but the ſame which was from the beginning; and that was the ſound of the word of the firſt ſeventh day of the Law of righteouſneſſe to Adam and now it is the found of the word of the ſeventh day of the Law of rigeteouſneſſe of faith, firſt propheticall and now Evangelicall. And though the Apoſtle to the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes: <hi>Hebrewes</hi> 7.12. doth affirme, that with the Leviticall Prieſthood the Law was changed: Yet we muſt underſtand, that the Law of righteouſneſſe is never really changed, though the Law be formerly changed, from the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall propheticall ceremoniall obligement, by the propheticall Sabbath, to the formall Evangelicall obligement of the law, by the Lords day, by the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate command whereof, the ſeventh day of the propheticall ceremoniall Sabbath, implying the whole morall propheticall ceremoniall law is actually determined, &amp; the Lords day, the ſeventh day of the Evangelicall law, implying the whole moral evangelicall law, actually eſtabliſhed by the new Covenant.</p>
                  <p>Let the thankeleſſe objecter therefore, doe but determine the ſeventh day of the propheticall Sabbath (ſet downe to Moſes in the decalogue) by the Lords day, as the Lord himſelfe hath determined the ſame, by the word of the Lords daies Evangelicall reſt: And he ſhall finde, that the Lords day, and the whole morall Evangelicall law, is ſet downe in ten ſeverall morall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts. My third anſwer to the antecedent of this fearfull objection, is this. It was the infinit wiſdome, and the infinit love and mercy of God to man, that the Evangelicall morall law of faith, was not ſet downe in the written word, in diſtinct formall precepts, as it was ſet downe to Moſes, in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheticall decalog: for if the Evangelicall law had bin ſo ſet downe: the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall propheticall law, and the whole old Teſtament had bin quite miſregar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: Without the true knowledge whereof there is no foundation for Chriſtian faith: I next anſwer to the conſequent, of the objection.</p>

                  <head type="sub">The Lords day is by the immediate command of the Lords owne word, and not by the command of the word of the Church.</head>
                  <p>THe conſequent of the objection, is, that the Lord hath left, the power of the commanding of his bleſſed day to the Apoſtolicall ſucceſſors (the Miniſters of his Word and Sacraments) to appoint, for the Lords day, what day of the weeke they ſhall thinke fitting: To this I anſwer, that this is all one to affirme, that the Lord hath left, to the Apoſtolicall ſucceſſors, the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to be God himſelfe. For it is by the only merit of the Lords Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:49359:110"/> ſeventh dayes reſt, ariſing from his bloudy reſt, that the Apoſtolicall ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors themſelves, and that all men under the heavens have the continua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their redeemed light and life, moving and being. It is moſt certaine, that there was great power given to the Apoſtles, and in the Apoſtles, to the Apoſtolicall ſucceſſors, though all the power given to the Apoſtles, was not given to the Apoſtolicall ſucceſſors, and Miniſters of the word.</p>
                  <p>But all the created powers of heaven and earth are not capable of any ſuch power, as to command the Evangelicall worſhip of the Lords day, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying the command of the whole Evangelicall morall law of God.</p>
                  <p>The great power which was given to the Apoſtles, was, for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of the Evangelicall word of the ſeventh day of the law of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of faith, implying the whole word and law of God; which the Lord of the Lords day, did plant, while he was perſonally upon earth, and wate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with his precious bloud: for the enabling of the Apoſtles to the eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing and encreaſe whereof, the Keyes of the kingdome of Heaven (that rich Pearle) were delivered to the Apoſtles, which are the keyes of the Old and New Teſtament; this power of the keyes of the kingdome of heaven, delivered to the Apoſtles was threefold. The firſt was the power of the light of the word, which did ſhine from the word it ſelfe, the Lord of the law of righteouſneſſe of faith. By which power the Apoſtles were enabled to teach and preach the Evangell to all the Nations of the world. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond power of the word was, the power of healing, diſpoſeſſing, and the power of miracles, whereby their doctrine was confirmed, and the Evangell eſtabliſhed. The third was the power of command, whereby obedience was given to the word taught and preached by the Apoſtles.</p>
                  <p>The power of the light of the word, whereby the Apoſtles were enabled to teach and preach, was morall and ſpirituall: the morall light, was the light of the ſound of the mediate word of the Lord of life; by which light, the Apoſtles were firſt literally led to the Lords merit, by his Evangelicall reſt, which is the firſt light leading to the kingdome of heaven. The glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous riches of this light, (bought at the price of the ſacred bloud of the Lord of light) was prefigurate by the light of the golden Candleſticks, in the holy place, and by the rich robe and veſture of the high Prieſt; as alſo the ſound of this rich word, was prefigurate by the ſound of the bells, hanging at the high Prieſts rich veſture, <hi>Exod.</hi> 28.33.</p>
                  <p>The ſpirituall light, by which the Apoſtles were enabled to teach and preach the Evangell, was in the ſpirituall ſanctifying underſtanding of the word of the law of righteouſneſſe, which the Apoſtles received of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit, of the Lord of light and life, immediately ſignified by our Saviour<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                     <pb n="212" facs="tcp:49359:111"/> breathing upon the Apoſtles, <hi>John</hi> 20.22. while as he ſaid. Receive yee the holy Spirit, by which power of ſanctifying light the Apoſtles were enabled with the ſpiritual power, to teach and preach, and with the holineſſe of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall action, whereby they ſhined as pure light in the darkeneſſe of the world, leading all men to the kingdome of heaven, who were able to be led by that light. This pure light of ſpirituall righteouſneſſe, was likewiſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figurate, <hi>Exod.</hi> 28.36. by the inſcription of righteouſneſſe and holineſſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graven in the Breſt-plate of the high Prieſt, and by the high Prieſts white pure veſture, with which he was cloathed, when he went in once a yeare, into the holieſt place, to obtaine pardon of actuall ſin, at the Mercy-ſeat. And this is the light and holineſſe of life, with which the Apoſtolicall ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, are to be continually veſted to goe in and out before their charge.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond power of the Keyes of the word, whereby the Apoſtles were enabled, <hi>Marke</hi> 16.17. was the power of healing, diſpoſeſſing of poſſeſſed with evill ſpirits, and with the power of miracles, which was given to the Apoſtles, for the confirmation of their doctrine, and for the eſtabliſhing of the Evangell, planted by the Lord of the Lords day, ſealed by his precious bloud. Which being eſtabliſhed by the Apoſtles, and the eſtabliſhing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſealed likewiſe by their owne bloud, the power of healing, diſpoſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and miracles, did determine in the Apoſtles, according to the eternall decree of God. And this power of the word given to the Apoſtles, was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe prefigurate by Aarons Rod, placed by the word, in the Arke of the Covenant.</p>
                  <p>The third power of the Keyes of the word, given to the Apoſtles, <hi>John</hi> 20.23. (which is likewiſe given in the Apoſtles, to the Apoſtolicall ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors) is the morall power of commanding the obedience of man, to the command of the word. And this power doth conſiſt in mercy and juſtice: In mercy, the authority is given to pardon the morall ſin of the penitent ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous contemner, of the command of the word delivered by the Apoſtles and Miniſters of the word. The power of juſtice, is in the authority of the morall ſword of excommunication. Whereby the proud rebellious contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the word (preached by the Apoſtles and Miniſters of the word) are cut off from the viſible Church, and from the bleſſing of the Lords merit, which is by the hearing of his word. To the end that Evangelicall morall obedience, may be given to the teaching and preaching of the word. Now becauſe the pardon of ſpirituall ſinne, is incommunicable to any created po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of God; The Lord therefore did obliege himſelfe by Covenant to the Apoſtles, and in the Apoſtles, to the Apoſtolicall ſucceſſors, to remit, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, ſpiritually, what morall ſin ſoever the Apoſtles ſhould pardon or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:49359:111"/> morally upon earth, which is a moſt admirable power, given to the Miniſters of the Word: For, by this power of the keys, the proudeſt rebellious contemner of the command of God, ſounded by the Miniſters of the word and ſacraments, is brought to ſubjection. And that for two main reaſons: The firſt is, becauſe the proud contemner being excommunicate, the ſin is never pardoned by God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it be firſt pardoned by the Miniſters of the Word, which is a moſt fearfull caſe, if the contemner, ſhould die in his impenitency and obſtinacy. The ſecond reaſon is, becauſe the civill ſword of the Magiſtrate, is to ſecond the power of the morall ſword, to free the Church of God from ſuch proud contempt, to whoſe protection the militant Church of God is committed, as to the Father of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, to be preſerved in the purity of the light of the word, and in the freedome of the profeſſion of the word, in which reſpect the twofold portion of the firſt born, is due by the law of God to the King. The firſt is, the inheritance of the crown; for the enabling of the King to advance the obedient (to the command of the word) who are alwayes his moſt faithfull and loyall ſubjects. The ſecond is the power of the civill ſword (implying the power of the King) to cut from the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litant Church, the proud contemner of the command of God by his Church, that by baniſhment, impriſonment, or what manner of puniſhment in that kind (it ſhall pleaſe the King to inflict) the word commanded by the Church may be freed from contempt; for it is impoſſible, that he that is a rebell to God and to his Church can ever be a faithfull ſubject to the King.</p>
                  <p>To the Kings faithfull execution of this twofold power of righterouſneſſe, the infallible bleſſing of the Lords merit by his ſeventh dayes Evangelicall reſt is due by the law of God, whereby the King hath the happier continuation of redeemed grace of life and light, and the temporall bleſſing of God upon all his actions in this life, and his eternall reſt, (crowned with an incorruptible crown of glory) in the life to come; and ſo much for anſwer to the ſecond objection. The laſt objection is of no great conſequence, yet the objection muſt be anſwered.</p>

And it was ſo truly called by bothp: For, John, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.5, 6. doth name the day, as the Lord himſelf did name his bleſſed day to the Iewes, calling it his own day: and Paul doth call the Lords day, the firſt day of the week, as the Lords day is the eighth day incluſively, from the laſt formall Iewiſh propheticall Sabbath, prefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurate
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:49359:112"/> by the ſacrament of circumciſion, which was the true firſt day of the week, according to the Iewiſh ſabbaticall account, who did begin the firſt day of their week upon the next day immediatly ſucceeding the formall propheticall Jews ſabbath; and the firſt day immediatly ſucceeding the laſt formall Iewes Sabbath was the day of Chriſts reſurrection from the grave, the Lords day. For it was the wiſdome of the Spirit of God in the Apoſtles (I in the eſtabliſhing of the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell) not to name the Lords day, either the ſeventh day of the Evangelicall law, or the ſeventh day of the week; leſt thereby the Apoſtles ſhould have given ſuch diſtaſte to the obſtinate Iewes, as that the Iews ſhould have utterly rejected the embracing of the Evangel in the firſt entry: For, the ſeventh day of the prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall Iews ſabbath, was the very ground and foundation of all the Iews religion, which was the morall glory of the world at that time: and the ground of all the meanes, and of the great preferment of the tribe of Levi. And therefore both Paul and the Apoſtles (at firſt) did mildly wink at, and paſſe over the Iews uſing (or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the abuſing) of many judaicall ceremonies, even to the adminiſtration of the propheticall ſacraments; and all to win the obſtinate Iews by all fair means to the embracing of the Evangell, not otherwiſe to have been tolerate.</p>
                  <p>But after (by the great mercy of God) the Evangel began to take ſome footing, the Evangel by degrees, began to be boldly preached, and the Lords day began to beworſhipped, and (in tract of time) practiſed by the Apoſtles, received by Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours, Kings, Princes and ſtates from age to age, and at length, to be decreed in Generall Councels, to the admiration of the world: For, ſuch was the former glory of the Propheticall, Judaicall Sabbath, as it might have ſeemed (to a naturall man) impoſſible that the Lords day could ever have been ſo generally received. But whatſoever men may conceive, the only reaſon was, that the ſound of the word of the Lords day, doth pierce by the eares, to the heart of God man, where the redeemed word of the law is internally written; the literall light whereof, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing really one with the literall light of the Lords day, the heart is immiediatly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, and the conſcience moved to conſent to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded obedience of that bleſſed day; for the ſeventh day of the law of God (implying the command of the whole law) hath the prerogative above all the lawes of man under the heavens: For the Evangelicall ſeventh day of the law of faith, doth immediatly oblige the conſcience, which all the lawes of man cannot do, but mediately; and that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, unleſſe the law of man be grounded upon the law of God: So that now (in the great mercy of God in his Son Chriſt Ieſus) by our received Chriſtian account, the Lords day, is the ſeventh day of our Chriſtian week, beginning the firſt Lords day of our Chriſtian week upon the next day immediatly ſucceeding the Lords day, vulgarly called Munday; from which day, reckoning to the ſeventh: The ſeventh day is the Lords, which is the laſt day of our Chriſtian week, containing

                  <p n="16">16. That day which the Lord reſted from the fulfilling of the law, that day was bleſſed, ſanctified and commanded, by the power of the Lords merit of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life due by the law to the Lords fulfilling of the law. The Lord reſted his owne day, from the fulfilling of the law: The Lords day therefore, was bleſſed,

Without the knowledge of the Lords day, no man can know that he is a ſinner, againſt the Evangelicall law, or that he ſtands in need of the Lords merit to ſave him from the curſe of the Evangelicall law of faith.

                  <p n="22">22. Whom the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, by his immediate word, did command to preach and teach the Evangelicall bleſſing of his merit, whereby the Lords day is bleſſed and ſanctified; them the Lord Jeſus Chriſt (by his immediate word) did command the Evangelicall worſhip of the day, to which the bleſſing of his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is only due. The Lord Jeſus Chriſt, by his immediate Word, did command the Apoſtles to preach and teach, to all the nations of the world the Evangelicall bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of his merit, whereby the Lords day is bleſſed and ſanctified. The Lord Jeſus Chriſt therefore, by his immediate word, did command the Apoſtles to teach and preach the Evangelicall worſhip of the Lords day, to which the evangelicall bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of his merit is only due. And now to conclude, leſt I weary my Reader.</p>
                  <p n="23">23. That day of dayes; that decreed day (ſealed by the precious blood of the immaculate Lambe) which no power, time, or day, can determine, but the ſecond coming of the eternall day, when the myſticall members of Chriſt Jeſus, ſhall reſt in their head, crowned with an incorruptible crown of glory in the heauen of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens eternally; that is, the true evangelicall ſeventh day of the law of faith by the new covenant, obliging and commanding all the nations of the world, to the joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full jubelizing of that bleſſed day. The Lords day, that decreed day, (ſealed with the Lords precious blood) no power, day, or time, can determine, but the ſecond coming of the Lord, (the eternall day) when his myſticall members ſhall reſt in him their head, crowned with an incorruptible crown of glory in the heaven of heavens eternally. The Lords day therefore is the true evangelicall ſeventh day of the law of faith, by the new covenant, obliging and commanding all the nations of the world, to the joyfull jubelizing of the Lords day.</p>
                  <p>Thus by the only and immediate aſſiſting grace of the Lord of the Lords day, (without the aid or help of any mortall man) have we finiſhed theſe three books of the Theologicall key, by manifeſting of the revealed truth of his ſacred day, ſo long darkned and obſcured, by the darkneſſe of the miſerable age. And now for a full concluſion of this Tractate (according to our pomiſe in the ſecond Chapter of the ſecond book) the pretended abſolute decree, (whereby the hearts of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Chriſtians hath been from time to time diſtracted) ſhall be examined, with other opinions in the like kinde, concerning the ſacred decree of Predeſtination, (which for the Readers better ſatisfaction) ſhall be demonſtratively reſolved, from the loweſt and laſt effect, in the ſupreme and firſt cauſe, as the eternall word,

                     <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Oncerning the ſacred Decree of Predeſtination, there be four ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall opinions ſet down by the Authors: The firſt is, the Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gian and ſemipelagian opinion, which in ſubſtance and effect, are both one: For, by both, the grace to fulfill the law of God, is aſcribed to the freedome of mans own election; though by the ſemipelagian opinion, the grace is parted between God and man. Both the opinions are pretended to be grounded upon a fundamentall The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ologicall principle; which principle is ſet down in the firſt Chapter of the firſt book of the Theologicall key, which is in this manner: As God doth command the action of his intellectuall creature man, as well upon the eternall curſe of the law; as upon the bleſſing of the ſeventh dayes reſt: So God in his juſtice, by his covenant, is obliged to enable man to the performing of the command of his law, and man being the free intellectuall creature of God, it is affirmed, that it is in the freedome of mans own election, to fulfill or tranſgreſſe the Law of God: And that God (out of his eternall preſcience of mans fulfilling or tranſgreſſing of the law) hath decreed accordingly the election or condemnation of man; ſo that the ſuſpending, or not ſuſpending of the ſacred decree of Predeſtination, (by theſe opinions) muſt ſtand at the beck of the creature. The only truth of theſe two opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions is, that the will of man is not neceſſitate, by Gods eternall decree, to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe the law. Now, becauſe the untruth of theſe two opinions, hath been from age to age condemned; as contradictory to the ſacred Word of God: my purpoſe is not to do an act done; but to declare the groſſe error in the miſtake of the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall principle, whereon the opinio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>s are pretended to be grounded. It is moſt certain, that God in his juſtice doth oblige himſelf to man by his covenant, to enable man to the fulfilling of the command of his law. But, by the favour of
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:49359:116"/> the authors and maintainers of theſe opinions, the ſtate of man muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, wherein God doth oblige himſelfe to man, by his ſeverall Covenant; in which ſenſe, this principle is to be conceived, and not ſimply. It is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all doubt, that God by his firſt Covenant made with man in Adam, crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the ſtate of naturall and ſpirituall perfection, did oblige himſelfe to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, to enable Adam in the ſtate of perfection, wherein he was created, by the eternall bleſſing of his firſt ſeventh daies reſt. But God did mutually ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige Adam to merit that bleſſing, by the eternall perfection of his obedience to the command of his law, obliging Adam likewiſe to the eternall curſe of his law, upon Adams diſobedience, whoſe obedience or diſobedience (by the firſt Covenant) was left to the freedome of his owne election, to ſtand or fall, at his pleaſure or perill, for the freedome of Adams election wherein he was created, was ſuch, as no increated or created power could neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate Adams will to fall, and yet Gods eternall decree, was not ſuſpendible by Adam, as hath beene formerly and neceſſarily concluded: to which I muſt referre the Reader.</p>
                  <p>So it is likewiſe moſt certaine, that God hath entered his new Covenant, with man, in the redeemed ſtate of man from the curſe of eternall darkneſſe, and from eternall death by that darkneſſe, (to which all men were condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned) ſhut up in temporall ſpirituall darkneſſe, till the naturall man be regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, whereby man (as he is a naturall man,) is enabled to give morall obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to his calling, by the new Covenant, without any manner of neceſſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the will of man, either naturally or morally to diſobedience. It is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe moſt certaine, that God hath obliged himſelfe, by his new Covenant, to the actuall continuation of the redeemed naturall and morall grace of man, for all the day of this life, upon the continuation of mans morall obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; till Gods prefixed time of ſpirituall calling, to whoſe finall, perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, in his morall obedience, the ſpirituall grace of faith is then due to the naturall man, by the new Covenant. And therefore the Evangel is ſaid to be, the power of God to ſalvation from faith to faith, that is from the grace of morall faith, to the grace of ſpirituall faith.</p>

                  <p>THe third opinion, concerning the ſacreed decree of predeſtination, is, the fearefull abſolute reſpectiveleſſe decree; which, according to the authors and maintainers, is ſet downe after this manner. God, out of his alone inſcrutable will and pleaſure, (to be adored by man) by his decree of predeſtination, without all reſpect to the creation, fall, and redemption of man, and without all ſubordinate reſpect whatſoever, did decree from all eternity, to elect a certaine number of men to eternall ſalvation, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne a certaine number of men, (to wit) the reſt of the world to the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall torments of hell. And becauſe nothing can come to paſſe, which muſt not fall under this irreſiſtible decree; therefore it is peremptorily affirmed, that by this decree, Adams will was neceſſitate, to fall under the eternall curſe of the law, and in Adam, all men created in Adam.</p>
                  <p>But we muſt likewiſe conceive by this opinion, that though by this neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitating o the will of Adam, Adam was irreſiſtibly neceſſitate to fall under the eternall curſe of the law; yet Adam as he was man, did likewiſe freely fall; and this falling of man, implying his creation, is called (by the Authors and maintainers of this opinion) the execution of his decree: of whom, if we doe aske the efficient cauſe of the fall of man; it is anſwered, that it was the willing yeelding of man to Satans temptation, but neceſſitate by this abſolute irreſiſtible decree.</p>
                  <p>Now, becauſe the impoſſibility of the neceſſitating of Adams will, to fall under the fearefull eternall curſe of the law, by any act or decree of God whatſoever, hath beene formally neceſſarily, and demonſtratively conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, in the ſecond Chapter of the ſecond booke of this tract<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

Next therefore, it doth reſt that this abſolute decree be examined; which wee will doe, by looking thereon with the light of the truth of the ſacred word, that the Reader may ſee whether or not there was any ſuch irreſiſtible power in this decree, to neceſſitate Adams will, to ſuch as fearefull fall, being created in the ſtate of ſuch ſpirituall perfection, as was equall to the perfection of the command of the law, whereby he was oblieged; though it was in the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of his election, by the firſt Covenant, to ſtand or fall, at his pleaſure or perill.</p>

Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venthly, man (by this decree) muſt be conceived without reſpect to his creation, or to his merit by his fall, or to his redemption by the blood of Chriſt Ieſus. Twelfth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, (by this opinion) man muſt be conceived to be elected, without reſpect to the love and mercy of God to man in his Sonne Chriſt Ieſus: and to be condemned by the eternall curſe of the law, without reſpect to his merit by any tranſgreſſion of the law: All which reſpects are ſubordinate to this abſolute decree, which the decree doth tranſcend; for it is out of the alone pleaſure of God, ſummounting all ſuch ſubordinate reſpect. And ſo much for my firſt affirmation.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I doe boldly and peremptorily affirme that man is to conceive and apprehend God only, as he hath revealed himſelfe to man by his ſacred word and covenants, eſtabliſhed upon his ſeverall ſeven dayes reſt, and not to prye ſaucily in the ſecret counſell of God, and to imagine ſuch a fictious opinion, contrary to his word and truth, and to obtrude the ſame to man for his ſacred truth; for by this opinion, all the promiſes of ſalvation, offered to all the Nations of the world (by a world of frivolous diſtinctions) are made onely to the elect: and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently this abſolute decree, is abſolutely repugnant to the truth of the ſacred word of God. What is regeſtred in the ſacred word of God, wee may boldly conclude to bee decreed by God from all eternity; but we muſt not imagine a decree to be decreed by God to conſtraine us to wreſt the Scripture to maintaine the credit of any ſuch imaginary opinion of man.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, I doe boldly and peremptorily affirme, that the very tearmes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the authors and maintainers, doe expreſſe this pretended abſolute decree, doth neceſſarily imply, all the reſpects formally ſet downe by us: For firſt, in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of God, we neceſſarily name God, as God hath revealed himſelfe to man; which was firſt, God of the law of righteouſneſſe Creator, by his word of the firſt ſeventh dayes reſt. Secondly, God of the law of righteouſneſſe of faith, in the promiſe of the bleſſed ſeed, by the word of his Sabbaticall ſeventh dayes reſt, whereby God did manifeſt himſelfe to man, God, in the three coeſſentiall diſtinct perſons of the Trinity, Creator and Redeemer of man; firſt Prophetically by the wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d the Propheticall ſeventh day of the law, then by the name of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath of the Lord: And now Evangelically by the word of the Lords day, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day of the Evangelicall law of righteouſneſſe of faith. Secondly, by the word of election (which is onely in the Lord Ieſus Chriſt the eternall Sonne of God, God equall with the Father and holy Spirit) the creation of man (in the ſtate of perfection) the obliging of man to the firſt covenant, the fall of man un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the eternall curſe of the law, and the redemption of man from the curſe is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily implyed. Thirdly, by the condemnation of man (out of the alone plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:49359:118"/> of God) to the eternall torments of hell (which is the curſe of the law) both the merit of man by the tranſgreſſion of the law, and the juſtice of God by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning of man are neceſſarily implyed. So that this abſolute pretended decree, which the Authors doe obtrude to us, as free from all reſpect (by the very tearms whereby they doe expreſſe their imaginary decree) is charged, with all manner of reſpect ſubordinate to God: and conſequently there is a flat contradiction between the furmiſed opinion, and the tearmes whereby the opinion is expreſſed. The abſolute decree therefore being repugnant to the literall light and truth of the word of the Lords day (the ſeventh day of the Evangelicall law of faith ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily implying the literall light of all the ſeverall word of the ſeventh dayes reſt from the foundation of the world.) The abſolute decree (according to our twofold Theologicall Canon, ſet downe in the tenth Chap. of the ſecond book of our Theologicall key) is a falſe and adulterous tenent of faith ariſing from the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of error. This error doth proceed from the confounding of the immanent and tranſeant act of God, which muſt no wayes be confounded: for the immanent act of God (being God himſelfe eſſentially) is only abſolute, neceſſary, infinite, and incomprehenſible by the act of any created underſtanding. And his tranſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant act is only free; which as it is tranſeant and terminate to man, it is onely by his word, which is his law to man, the image of his eternall life and light of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, neceſſarily implying the naturall life and light of the word: for by the onely power of the word written in the heart of man, man is inabled to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand God by the word of the ſeventh day of the law, as God hath revealed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to man by his ſeverall ſeventh dayes reſt from the beginning. Now the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed decree being abſolute, and without all ſubordinate reſpect, it is pretended to be the immanent act of God; but becauſe the immanent act of God is infinite: The maintainers of the abſolute decree, are conſtrained to expreſſe their imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary opinion by the tearmes of the tranſeant act of God, which is by his word; for the ſalvation and damnation of man, is the twofold reward of the word and law of God; to wit, the bleſſing and curſe of the law. Fourthly and laſtly, by the ſalvation of man (out of the alone pleaſure of God) without reſpect to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; the alone pleaſure of God doth intervene between the faith of man and the Lords merit; whereby the faith of man is overthrown, and by the damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of man (out of the alone pleaſure of God) without reſpect to the merit of man, the alone pleaſure of God by the condemning of man doth intervene between the merit of man (by the tranſgreſſion of the law) and the law; whereby the juſtice of God is overthrowne. Now though the fearefull unworthineſſe of this miſerable opinion, doth not merit the refutation thereof, by any Theologicall penne: yet for the Readers ſatisfaction, I thus demonſtrate, that ſuch a pretended abſolute de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree never was, or could be decreed by God.</p>

                  <p>God in his eternall purpoſe, hath decreed from all eternity, to offer his graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous promiſes of ſalvation, in his Son, Chriſt Jeſus, loſt in Adam, in the ſtate of corruption, of which corrupted eſtate, God hath decreed from all eternity, to elect a certain number, by predeſtinating them, to be glorified with his Son Chriſt Jeſus, and to relinquiſh the reſt in their ſtate of corruption; who, becauſe they do wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulfully contemn the grace ſo freely offered; God therefore hath moſt juſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed to condemn them.</p>
                  <p>This aſſertion I do affirm, (by receiving of a ſafe inſtruction) to be the true ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of the ſacred decree of predeſtination, as the decree is execute, by the eternall word immediatly, by his ſeverall covenants made with man, eſtabliſhed upon his immediate ſeverall ſeven dayes reſt, which is the reaſon, that this opinion is ſo diſtaſtfull to the maintainers of the abſolute decree, being ſo repugnant, to ſuch falſe adulterous light; for this aſſertion doth neceſſarily imply all the reſpects which are denied by the abſolute decree: Firſt, by this aſſertion (contrary to the abſolute decree) Gods free purpoſe of the election of man, is with reſpect of his love and mercy to man, in his Son, Chriſt Jeſus. Secondly, (contradictory to the abſolute decree) Gods condemnation of man, is with reſpect to the finall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of man, by his contenming of the gracious promiſes of ſalvation, ſo freely offered by the new covenant. Thirdly, (contradictory to the abſolute decree) by this aſſertion, Gods free election in his Son Chriſt Jeſus is affirmed to be with reſpect to the object of his election, which (in the order of cauſe) is the ſtate cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by them, the ſtate of corruption, to wit, the ſtate of man freed from the curſe of the law for the ſin of Adam, ſhut up in ſpirituall darkneſſe.

Fourthly, (contradictory to the abſolute decree) this aſſertion is with reſpect to the naturall and morall freedome of the action of the naturall man by the immediate act of the redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, without any manner of neceſſitating of the naturall or morall act of man, by any decree of God: For by affirming that the gracious promiſes offered by the new covenant, are wilfully contemned by man; this redeemed freedome of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall and morall action of the naturall man, is neceſſarily implied. Fifthly, (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory to the abſolute decree) this aſſertion is firſt with reſpect to the ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate obliging of man to the law of righteouſneſſe by the firſt covenant; neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily implied in the corrupted eſtate of man, named by the authors of the laſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion: Secondly, the aſſertion is with reſpect to the new covenant; for the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall promiſes of ſalvation, are offered by the new covenant. Sixthly, (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory to the abſolute furmiſed decree) by this aſſertion, Adams will is not affirmed to be neceſſitate to fall under the fearfull curſe of the law, by any actor decree of God. Seventhly (contradictory to the opinion of the maintainers of the abſolute decree) the gracious promiſes of ſalvation, are affirmed to be made to all the nations of the world. Eighthly (contradictory to the opinion of the maintainers of the abſolute decree) the redemption of all men from the curſe of the law for the ſin of Adam, is neceſſarily implied in this aſſertion. Ninthly, this aſſertion, (ontradictory to the abſolute decree) is conſonant to the literall light of the Lord dayes Evangelicall reſt, neceſſarily implying the literall light of his bloody ſabbaticall ſeventh dayes reſt; and conſequently the literall light of all the ſeventh dayes reſt of the eternall word from the foundation of the world up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which ſeverall ſeven dayes reſts, all the ſeverall covenants made by God with man, are imediatly eſtabliſhed; as hath been faithfully delivered throughout this whole Tractate, whereby the whole exercite act of the ſacred decree of predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation is execute by the eternall Word imediatly.</p>

                  <head type="sub">The demonſtrative reſolution of the ſacred decree of eternall predeſtination from the laſt effect of the covenants of God made with man in the ſupreme indemonſtrable cauſe.</head>
                  <p>THe firſt three covenants made by God with man, are only the execution (or to uſe the ſchool phraſe) the exercit act of the eternall decree of predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, ſo far as is revealed thereof to man in this life, by the truth of the ſacred word. Which three ſeverall formall Covenants, are eſtabliſhed betweene God and man, upon the immediate command of the word of the ſeventh day of the law of God (implying the command of the whole law) obliging the obedience of man to his law, as God hath revealed himſelfe to man, by his ſeverall formall ſeventh daies reſt. The firſt Covenant is eſtabliſhed, upon the immediate command of the word of the firſt ſeventh day of the law: whereby God by his firſt ſeventh daies reſt, from the works of the creation did manifeſt himſelfe externally by his word to Adam) Creator of heaven and earth, of man, and of the creatures created for man. As by the lively word of the law, written in Adams heart, God did reveale himſelfe internal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to Adam, God of the law of righteouſnes. By which lively word (in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams heart) Adam was enabled to fulfill the command of the law, implied in the firſt ſeventh day, by fulfilling whereof, Adam was to merit, the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation of the perfection of his created eſtate and felicity, eternally upon earth. But Adam and all men created in Adam (naturally to diſcend of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam) by his diſobedience (deceived by the trechery of Satan) was condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the firſt Covenant, to the curſe of the law by eternall death and darkneſſe. Vpon Gods eternall preſcience, of which fearfull fall of man (by Satans malicious trechery) God (out of his infinit love and mercy to man in his Son Chriſt Jeſus) did decree from eternity to revenge the blood of man, upon Satan, by man the only ſon of his love, who according to his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall decree, made his ſecond Covenant with man, in the promiſe of the bleſſed ſeed: which Covenant (called the old Covenant) is eſtabliſhed upon the word of the ſecond ſeventh daies promiſed reſt, then by the name, of the Sabbath of the Lord, obliging Adam (and all men naturally to deſcend of Adam) to beleeve the Lords promiſed reſt of the bleſſed ſeed, who did covenant to reſt upon the Sabbath from the redemption of man, from the curſe of the law, for the ſinne of Adam.</p>
                  <p>By the third ſeventh daies reſt (which is the Lords daies reſt) the Lord, by his reſurrection from the dead, did reſt from the fulfilling of his promiſe of
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:49359:121"/> the bleſſed ſeed; upon the immediate command of which ſeventh day (to wit the Lord day.) The new Covenant is eſtabliſhed betweene God and man, obliging all men, to beleeve the fulfilling of the Lords promiſe by his Evangelicall ſeventh daies reſt, to whoſe faith, the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>it, by his Evangelicall ſeventh daies reſt, is due by the new Covenant. The old and new Covenant therefore being really one, the one containing the gracious promiſe of the bleſſed ſeed, the other the fulfilling of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, by the reſolution of the new Covenant both are reſolved, in this demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrative reſolution, therefore the firſt and new Covenant are reſolved: For the Readers better conceiving of this reſolution: Firſt, both the firſt and new Covenant are to be reſolved, firſt as both the Covenants are referred to God, and next as they are referred to man.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it is to be obſerved, that all the mediate effects ariſing from the Covenants, as they are effects produced by the next immediate ſuperior cauſe. So the ſame effects, are the immediate cauſes of the next immediate ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate effect: All except the ſupreame indemonſtrable cauſe of all: And ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the immediate cauſe of Adams and Eves fal, which have no poſitive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, from the decree of God; though God did decree from all eternity, to permit the fall of both (for God did Covenant with man, to leave Adam, to the freedome of his own election to ſtand or fall at his pleaſure and perill.) So that all the mediate cauſes and effects of the decree, are like ſo many linkes of a chaine, linkt one into another; all depending from the ſupreme cauſe of all: for as they doe all proceed from the ſupreme cauſe, ſo they doe all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to the ſame ſupreame indemonſtrable cauſe. So that if a man be diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, to ſet out the decree in a table, the two linkes of the chain (where Satan doth deceive Eve by the Serpent, and Eve doth induce Adam to fall) muſt not be linct one into another, but muſt contiguouſly depend after ſuch a form in a Table which the Author did intend if he had lived.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it is to be obſerved, that God by obliging both of himſelfe and man, upon the word of the ſeventh day of his Law: God and man (by his law) are linkt and (as it were) chained and bound one to another. God doth binde himſelfe to man, to the eternall continuation of the bleſſing of his ſeventh dayes reſt, and man to the eternall continuation of his obedience to the command of his law, and to the eternall curſe of the law upon his diſobedience: which mutuall bond is the maine ground, from whence all the mediate cauſe &amp; effects of the Coven<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap> come
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:49359:121"/> to the third mediate cauſe, in both the Covenants as they are referred to God; we muſt ſtop from aſcending with our reſolution, till by reſolving of the Covenants, as they are referred to man, wee meet with the like collate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall cauſes, which will be in all, foure in number. And then we aſcend from theſe foure cauſes, (as they are effects produced by one and the ſame next and immediate ſuperiour cauſe) till we come to the ſupreame indemon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrable caſe of all. To begin therefore with the firſt Covenant.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, as the Covenant is referred to God, and next as the firſt Covenant is referred to man. God by his firſt Covenant, doth firſt oblige himſelfe to Adam, (and to all men created in Adam naturally to deſcend of Adam) to the eternall continuation, of the naturall and ſpirituall perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of man, and the felicity wherein he was created, by the bleſſing of his firſt ſeveth dayes reſt. Secondly, God by his firſt Covenant doth mutually reoblige Adam (and all men naturally to deſcend of Adam) to the eternall continuation of the perfection of Adams obedience to the command of his law, both upon the eternall bleſſing, of his firſt ſeventh dayes reſt, to Adams obedience; and upon the eternall curſe of the law, to Adams diſobedience. From this reobliging of man by God to his Covenant, the word Religion doth take the name, implying the whole obedience of man to the law of God. To come therefore to the reſolution of the firſt Covenant, firſt, as the Covenant is referred to God. The laſt and loweſt effect, of the firſt Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, as the Covenant is referred to God, is Gods obliging of man to the obedience of the command of his law, upon the eternall bleſſing, of his firſt ſeventh dayes reſt, and upon the eternall curſe of the law by the firſt Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. The immediate cauſe of this obliging of Adam by God, in his ſtate of perfection, was. Gods eternall purpoſe, to manifeſt himſelfe to man, in his attribute of juſtice, by rendring the reward of the law, according to the merit of man. The immediate cauſe whereof, was Gods enabling of Adam, with ſuch naturall and ſpirituall perfection; as was equall to the perfection of the command of the law, whereby Adam was enabled to merit the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuation of the perfection, and felicity wherein he was created, eternally upon earth; whoſe ſtanding or falling, was left to the freedome of Adams election, by the firſt Covenant.</p>
                  <p>The immediate cauſe of Gods thus enabling of Adam, was the perfection of Adams creation; we muſt ſtop our reſolution at this cauſe, till we have the like collaterall cauſe, ariſing from the firſt Covenant as it is referred to man.</p>
                  <p>The firſt Covenant, as it is reffered to man, muſt be reſolved, both as the firſt Covenant was fulfilled by Adam, while Adam ſtood in the ſtate of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and likewiſe as the firſt Covenant was broke and tranſgreſſed by
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:49359:122"/> man. The laſt and loweſt effect of Adam, as hee was obliged by the firſt Covenant, (while Adam ſtood in his ſtate of perfection) was his perfect worſhip of the firſt ſeventh day; for, in the fulfilling of the ſeventh day, the whole law was fulfilled by Adam: by fulfilling whereof, Adams faith, and the eternall bleſſing of the firſt ſeventh dayes reſt, were actually (but not eternally) united: for the continuation of the bleſſing of the firſt ſeventh dayes reſt, to Adam, was according to the continuation of the perfection of his obedience. The immediate cauſe of Adams fulfilling of the command of the law (while Adam ſtood in his ſtate of perfection) was Adams ſaith in the eternall continuation of his eternall reſt by God, which was due to his obedience, by the law: and promiſed by Covenant, to which God obliged himſelfe. The immediate cauſe of Adams faith, was Adams love to ſpirituall righteouſnſſſe; that is, to God, ſpirituall righteouſneſſe it ſelfe, his gracious Lord God and Creator. The immediate cauſe of Adams ſpirituall love, was the ſpirituall ſanctifying light of the holy Spirit, enlightning Adams intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall ſoule, in the underſtanding of the law, as the law is ſpirituall. The immediate cauſe of this ſpirituall perfection of ſpirituall light and love in Adam, was the perfection of his creation, as he was created in the perfection of a ſpirituall man, and in the lively Image of God. And here we meet col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laterally with the firſt cauſe, as the firſt Covenant is referred to God, and ſo we have two of the foure cauſes: but we muſt not proceed to make the other two cauſes ariſe, from the new Covenant, till we reſolve the firſt Covenant, as it is referred to man, by Adam tranſgreſſing of the l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>w obliged by the firſt Covenant.</p>
                  <p>The loweſt and laſt effect therefore of Adams breaking of the firſt Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, was Adams tranſgreſſion and contempt of the command of the Law, which is ſin; by which tranſgreſſion, Adam and all men created in Adam, naturally to deſcend of Adam, were eternally united to the curſe of the law by the firſt Covenant, whereby all men were condemned to eternall death and darkneſſe, for the curſe of the law; the tranſgreſſion of man, by the firſt Covenant, was peremptory, without all time of repentance, or hope of revealed mercy.</p>
                  <p>The immediate cauſe of Adams tranſgreſſion of the law, was the ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted vertue, of the objective forbidden fruit, offered by Eve; by eating whereof, Adam did apprehend himſelfe, that he ſhould become like God. Where (by the way) the Reader may obſerve, that the immediate cauſe of Adams fall, was externall to Adam, which was the forbidden fruit, and Eves ſuggeſtion of the vertue of the fruit. The immediate cauſe of Eves preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the fruit, and of her ſuggeſtion, of the vertue of the fruit of Adam,
<pb facs="tcp:49359:122"/> was here deere love to Adam, to have Adam equall to God himſelfe, as Eve did apprehend her ſelfe to be, by the vertue of the fruit which ſhe did firſt eate. The immediate cauſe of Eves eating of the forbidden fruit, was her ambicious deſire, to have her ſelfe equall to God, and to be freed from that dying death, threatned by the Covenant. The immediate cauſe of Eves foule deſire, was the falſe ſuggeſtion of the Serpent, in ſuggeſting ſuch admirable vertue in the fruit. To the eating whereof, (without all doubt) Eve was the more eaſily enduced to beleeve the Serpents ſuggeſtion, of the vertue of the fruit of the tree of knowledge, becauſe there was ſuch vertue in the fruit of the tree of life, for by eating thereof, the ſenſitive nature of man was eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nallv preſerved; and therefore, after the fall, both Adam and Eve were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from Paradiſe.</p>
                  <p>The immediate cauſe therefore of Eves fall, was the Serpent, and the beautifull objective fruit of the tree of knowledge, and the ſuggeſted vertue of the fruit, which were all externall to Eve. Next, before wee ariſe with the reſolution to the ſupreme cauſe of all, the new Covenant is firſt to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, both as the new Covenant is referred to God, and as it is referred to man, where we ſhall meet with the two like collaterall cauſes; all which 4. Cauſes, as they are effects they are al produced by one and the ſame, next and immediate ſuperior cauſe: from whence we ariſe to the ſupreme cauſe of all.</p>
                  <p>By the laſt and loweſt effect therefore of the new Covenant, as it is refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to God; God in his Son Chriſt Jeſus, doth oblige the naturall man, in his redeemed ſtate of natural and morall grace. Firſt and immediately to the Evanglicall faithfull worſhip of the Lords day (the ſeventh day of the Evangelicall law) as the eternall word Chriſt Jeſus, hath revealed himſelfe by his Evangelicall ſeventh dayes reſt, ariſing from his bloudy reſt, Truth, in the fulfilling of his promiſe to man, and in that truth, God in the three co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſentiall diſtinct perſons of the glorious Trinity, cleerely and Evangelical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, without all propheticall myſtery or Ceremony. Secondly, God doth ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige the faithfull Evangelicall obedience of man, to the command of his whole Evangelicall law of righteouſneſſe of faith, implyed in the Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call ſeventh dayes commanded worſhip, both upon the eternal bleſſing of the Lords dayes Evangelical reſt, &amp; upon the mercileſſe curſe of the law of faith.</p>
                  <p>The immediate cauſe of Gods obliging of man, thus by his new Covenant, is, Gods eternall purpoſe, to manifeſt himſelfe, mercy and juſtice to man, by rendring of the reward of his Evangelicall law of faith, according to the faith of man obliged by his law. The immediate cauſe whereof, is Gods en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abling of the naturall man, with ſuch freedome of naturall and morall grace, as he is able to give morall obedience to his calling, by the new Covenant, without any manner of neceſſitating of his morall diſobedience. To the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
<pb facs="tcp:49359:123"/> mans finall perſeverance, in which morall obedience till Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed time of ſpirituall calling, the ſpirituall grace of faith is due to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall man by Covenant, whereby he hath the temporall bleſſing of the Lords dayes of Evangelicall reſt in this life, and eternal reſt in the life to come. The immediate cauſe of ſuch naturall &amp; morall grace, is the perfection of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of man. And here we fall in with the two former cauſes of the firſt covenant; for both the creation and redemtion of man, are by the ſame imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate cauſe: we muſt therefore yet ſtop our reſolution, till we meet with the fourth colatorall cauſe, ariſing from the new covenant, as the new covenant is referred to man, which muſt be likewiſe reſolved, both as the new covenant is fulfilled by man, and as the new covenant is broke and tranſgreſſed by man.</p>
                  <p>The laſt and loweſt effect of the regenerate man, as he is obliged to the command of the law of faith by the new Covenant, is, the faithfull Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call worſhip of the Lords day, to whoſe thankefull faithfull worſhip, the bleſſing of the Lords daies Evangelicall reſt, is temporally, naturally, and ſpiritually united in this life, and eternally in the life to come; as the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall, naturall, morall bleſſing, of the Lords daies reſt, is morally united to the morall worſhip of the naturall man. The immediate cauſe of the regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate mans faithfull worſhip of the ſeventh day, implying his obedience to the command of the whole law, is his ſpirituall faith. The immediate cauſe of his ſpirituall faith, is, his love to ſpirituall righteouſnes. The immediate cauſe of his ſpirituall love, is the ſanctifying light of the holy Spirit enlightning his underſtanding by his ſpirituall calling, in the immediate act of regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The immediate cauſe of his ſpiritnall calling, is the finall perſeverance of the naturall man in his morall obedience, according to the word of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, <hi>Mat:</hi> 13.13. <hi>whoſoever ſhall endure to the end, ſhall be ſaved.</hi> This end to the naturall man is Gods prefixed time of ſpirituall calling: for the naturall man, by his ſpirituall calling, being actually regenerate, is ſaved by ſpirituall faith, and conſequently juſtified. The immediate cauſe of the naturall mans finall perſeverance, in his morall obedience, is firſt and immediately, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the redemption, and ſecondly, Gods ſpeciall free concurſive grace, in ſaving of the naturall man, from being overcome by Satans temptations. This immediate cauſe, of the perfection of the redemtion, doth fall in, colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terally, with the three former cauſes, and ſo we have foure in number. But yet we muſt not riſe without reſolution, from theſe foure cauſes, till the new Covenant be reſolved, as the law is finally contemned and tranſgreſſed, by man, obliged to the new Covenant. The loweſt and laſt effect to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate, obliged to the new Covenant, is, his finall, willfull, obſtinate, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the gracious promiſes of Salvation, purchaſed by the ſacred bloud of the ſon of God. To the reprobates finall wilfull contempt whereof, by
<pb facs="tcp:49359:123"/> his unthankfull merit, the mercileſſe curſe of the law of fayth, is eternally u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited, whereby the reprobate is eternally condemned by God, upon his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall preſcience of the reprobates finall contempt, according to his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall decree: which is actually inflicted upon the ſoule of the reprobate, ſo ſoone as he departeth this life; and in the full extent both of ſoule and body in the great day, while by the reſurrection from the dead, the ſoule and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy being eſſentially reunited, the curſe of the Law in the full extent, is actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally and eternally inflicted upon man as he is man. The immediate cauſe of the reprobates finall wilfull obſtinate contempt, is the hardning of his heart. The immediate cauſe whereof, is the reprobates wilfull impenitent, obſtinat continuance in all ſin and wickedneſſe, by his contemning of God, in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temning of his law and truth, and of the profeſſors of the truth. The immediate cauſe whereof (as the cauſe is externall) is the objective temptations of Satan and of his wicked inſtruments, whereby the reprobate is ſpiritually and morally cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted from his childhood. The immediate cauſe of the reprobates continuance in ſin, (as the cauſe is internall) is his wilfull yeelding to be induced by the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Satan, and of his inſtruments, while there is nothing to neceſſitate his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall diſobedience, whereby the reprobate doth ſo wilfully, ungraciouſly, unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and preſumptuouſly contemn the blood of the new covenant.</p>
                  <p>Thus having the foure cauſes met together, we are to aſcend from the foure cauſes, as they are effects, produced by the next ſuperior immediate cauſe, to the ſupreme cauſe of all. The immediate cauſe therefore, of theſe foure ſeverall ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, as they are the immediate ſubordinate effects of the next and immediate ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour cauſe, is Gods eternall purpoſe, of the election of man, in his Son Chriſt Jeſus: For the immediate object of Gods eternall purpoſe of election is the ſtate of man, redeemed from the curſe of eternall death and darkneſſe, ſhut up in temporall ſpirituall darkneſſe, till he be regenerate: For, in this eſtate, all men are equally redeemed from the curſe of eternall death and darkneſſe, for their ſin in Adam; all equally ſhut up in temporall ſpirituall darkneſſe, all equally recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to the love and favour of God, for that firſt ſin; with ſuch freedom of morall grace, as all the created powers of God, are not able to neceſſitate the will of the redeemed naturall man, to morall diſobedience. To whoſe finall perſeverance, in his redeemed grace, (by his morall obedience) till Gods prefixed time of ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all calling, the grace of ſpirituall faith, is due by the new covenant; which is eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed with all men in the grace of this redeemed eſtate. Of this redeemed eſtate of man, God (without all impeachment to his juſtice) did decree, from all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, to elect to his mercy, a certain number of this redeemed ſtate of man, known to himſelf, by preſerving of them, from being finally overcome, by the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Satan and of his inſtruments in this life; and to leave a certain number, (known only to himſelfe) in this redeemed eſtate of naturall and morall grace, to
<pb facs="tcp:49359:124"/> be induced, or not induced, by Satan and his inſtruments to finall diſobedience at their pleaſure and perill: For, there is nothing to neceſſitate their will morally, and finally, to diſobedience. The immediate cauſe of Gods election of man in this redeemed eſtate, is the freedome of his mercy, who, in this caſe, will ſhew mercy on whom he will have mery, in his Son Chriſt Jeſus. The immediate cauſe of his ſhewing of mercy to ſome in this redeemed eſtate, is his foreknowledge of them, whom, from all eternity, he hath predeſtinate to be made like to the Image of his Son in this life. The immediate cauſe, that they are predeſtinate to be made like to the Image of his Son in this life, is, that Chriſt Jeſus, the eternall Son of God (made fleſh of the ſeed of the woman, in time) may be the firſt born amongſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny brethren, who are his myſticall members. The immediate cauſe that they are the myſticall brethren and members of their myſticall head (Chriſt Jeſus) is, that as their myſticall head (by the bloody perſecution of Satan and his cruell inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments) did ſeal the truth of his fulfilled promiſe of the bleſſed ſeed, with his heart blood: So his myſticall brethren and members, by taſting of the cup of his afflictions, (by the bloody perſecutions of Satan, and his curſed crue) may ſtand in the defence of the truth of their myſticall head valiantly, to the end of this life. The immediate cauſe whereof is to the end; that whereas the Lords myſticall members hath born the Image of his bloody perſecution in this life: So in the great day, they may (in their myſticall head) revenge the blood of man upon Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, by the finall breaking of the old Serpents head, and the head of his curſed ſeed, to their eternall confuſion. And that in recompence of their valour they may (in their myſticall head) be crowned with an incorruptible crown of glory, eternally and triumphantly; in all heavenly happineſſe in the life to come. The immediate cauſe whereof, is the Lords promiſe of the bleſſed ſeed, that the ſeed of the woman ſhall break the head of the Serpent; which ſeed of the woman, is firſt the Word the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, begot by his Father, man of the ſeed of the bleſſed Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine: And next his myſticall brethren, begot by the literall and ſpirituall light of the Word, brought forth by the woman, the Church. The immediate cauſe of the Lords promiſe of the bleſſed ſeed, is Gods eternall decree of predeſtination upon his eternall preſcience of the full of man, by the malicious treachery of Satan. The immediate cauſe of Gods eternall decree is Gods infinite love a and mercy to man, in his Son, Chriſt Jeſus (the Word made fleſh of the ſeed of the woman) from whoſe infinite love to man, as all the effects of his ſacred decree do proceed: So all return to the infinit eternall word, ſecond perſon of the glorious Trinity, God and man; God equall with the Father and holy Spirit, to whom with the Father, and holy Spirit, three coeſſentiall diſtinct perſons; one incomprehenſible, indiviſible, infinite eſſence, God of all power and majeſty, be aſcribed (of all creatures) all eternall honour, glory, power, praiſe, and thankſgiving, for his infinite truth, love and mercy to man, the only Rock and Reſt of the faith of man.</p>
